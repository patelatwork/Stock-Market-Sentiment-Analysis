Vijay Mallya video is pure PR,1l5eves,2025-06-07,4190,"Raj was brilliant in this podcast, he asked all valid questions, made sure he presented the media rhetoric. The facts are facts inspite of what the media makes it to be. He also asked about using kingfisher private jets for his own use, while under the law , it’s illegal but almost everyone does it. Including people who buy cars on their private limited name and use for their family trips- technically they should also be jailed. Second is banks overblowing kingfishers brand valuation , again if you have ever taken a home loan you will know that they will do two valuations above 1 crore and take the highest of the both.

This will teach Bangladesh a lesson for their actions. 🇮🇳💪,1kplhtc,2025-05-18,3572,"On May 18, 2025, I came across the news that India has put new restrictions on imports from Bangladesh. The Indian government has now blocked the entry of goods worth around $770 million—almost 42% of total imports from Bangladesh—through land ports. This decision came from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, based on instructions from the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT). Some of the major Bangladeshi products affected include ready-made garments, processed food, plastic products, cotton waste, and wooden furniture. For instance, garments from Bangladesh, which are worth about $618 million a year, can now only enter India through two seaports—Kolkata and Nhava Sheva in Mumbai. Previously, a large part of this trade happened through land routes, especially through West Bengal and the Northeastern states. Now, those land routes are closed for these goods. Another set of items worth about $153 million, such as flavored drinks and plastic items, are completely banned from being imported via land ports. To understand why India made this move, I looked into the background. Tensions between India and Bangladesh have been rising ever since a temporary government led by Muhammad Yunus took charge in Bangladesh. In recent months, Bangladesh has placed several restrictions on Indian exports. For example, since April 13, 2025, Bangladesh has not allowed yarn imports through land ports. Starting April 15, it also placed restrictions on rice imports from India through important border posts like Hili and Benapole. These trade barriers have frustrated India. Adding to this, Bangladesh has been getting closer to China and Pakistan, which has also annoyed Indian policymakers. This isn’t the first time India has responded to these shifts. Back on April 9, 2025, India withdrew a transshipment facility that it had granted Bangladesh in 2020. That facility had allowed Bangladesh to send goods to the Middle East and Europe through Indian ports and even via Delhi airport. Now, Bangladesh can no longer use that route. It has been limited to landlocked countries like Nepal and Bhutan. These new restrictions are likely to hit Bangladesh hard, especially its garment industry, which is a major part of the country’s economy. I found out that in 2023, Bangladesh exported $38 billion worth of garments globally, and $700 million of that went to India. What’s important is that 93% of these exports to India were made through land routes, which are now restricted. Because of this, exporters in Bangladesh may face higher costs and delays, which could hurt their business. Bangladesh is already the second-largest garment exporter in the world after China, and losing smooth access to the Indian market adds pressure. In terms of overall trade, India and Bangladesh had a total trade of $12.91 billion in FY24. Out of this, India exported $11.07 billion worth of goods to Bangladesh and imported $1.85 billion. This was a drop from the $14.24 billion total trade in 2022–23. The new restrictions could lower the trade volume even more and impact Bangladesh’s economy, which depends heavily on exporting to India. From India’s side, the move appears to be a way to hit back at Bangladesh for its recent trade restrictions and to protect local industries, especially textiles. India has made a few exceptions though. Products like fish, LPG, edible oils, and crushed stone are still allowed to enter through land ports. But overall, India seems to be sending a strong message that it is ready to adjust its trade policies to deal with both economic competition and changing geopolitical relationships. Bangladesh is a competitor in the textile market, and India may be trying to safeguard its own position. After looking at all this, it feels like India’s restrictions are not just about trade but also about asserting its influence in the region. By blocking goods worth $770 million from entering through land ports, India is clearly taking a tough stance. While it’s a move to protect its economy, it also reveals the growing tension between the two countries. If this continues, it could have lasting effects on trade and political relations in South Asia.

This will teach Bangladesh a lesson for their actions. 🇮🇳💪,1kplhtc,2025-05-18,3572,"Bangladeshi here. You guys scarce realize what a big L this is. Bangladesh exports about $70 billion a year. Exports to India stands at around 1 billion. Only about 1.5% of the total. Indian Import restrictions do not harm the economy and Indian demand is replacable with alternative international demands. India is a net exporter to Bangladesh, primarily in agricultural and livestock products, fertilizers and vehicles. While there's no inport restrictions on Indian goods, none of your exports to us are critical or non fungible. What this cost India is all the goodwill it had left. While Indians often like to pretend that everyone in Bangladesh is on Pakistan's side, or hates India, the reality on the ground is that a non insignificant portion of the population have a positive attitude towards India. Even after sacking the pro India Hasina regime, many would still argue for closer relations with India. But it's hard to argue for pivoting towards India when their government unilaterally, for no real reason, starts a trade war.",mtg8s7t,shadow_irradiant,1,2025-05-21,RELIANCE.NS,1,0,True,3,Negative,Neutral,bearish,-1,0

Almost every major restaurant in every big city sells on zomato. Z charges huge margins. Eateries cant discontinue zomato after using as it means revenue loss. Zomato has diversified into events and dining. Consumption class of india is gonna increase. Eating out and eating from outside is still a big thing for indians - fast food is semi luxury.

You can read the facts by yourself.,1kjtgg5,2025-05-11,1492,"This is not at all funny, actually we think Trump is a clown but US is playing a very strategic game here. He is playing the same cards he played with Ukraine and Russia. My understanding is he is starting to take interest in Bhikaristan, I would not be surprised if he will start brokering some deals with Pakistan in next few months, Bhikaristan will openly accept it because they are dying with debt. He will use that as a negotiation chip with India and even China. He knows China is developing the CPEC corridor and India already has conflicts in with BHikaristan. That's what Basturd Shebaaz was talking about in the last nights address that they will be successful very soon. This is the whole game plan that US is playing. Adani, Reliance and other industrialist not to mention China should be worried right now, because if this happens then they will have money to fund terrorists without begging for money. US will directly fund them in the name of business and fund terrorist directly. Also no other country will be able to attack them because US assets will be involved. This is an alarming situation, if India don't act right now. Both India and China will loose Bhikaristan. Why does he want to mediate between India and Pakistan now? Has anyone asked him to do that? When he says he does not want to be involved in some other countries conflict then why is he doing it now. This above is the reason Also as a side effect this will require too much too and fro between Indian and Bhikaristan in the name of trade, people, good and money will be exchanged and which will create more loopholes for security in our country.

Ola...My first good profit on a stock,1etm6lo,2024-08-16,1048,"I have been seeing people shitting on Ola since a few weeks before the IPO opened. Almost every post asking about the IPO was battered down by hoards of people saying the company has shitty fundamentals, shitty track record, shitty CEO, etc. People just don't like Bhavish Aggarwal in general, it seems. The first couple of days after listing was eerily silent on these subs, after everyone who shat on Ola saw their ""technical analysis"" down the drain. If we count both days as listing gains because any sane investor who believes in the company didn't sell, the IPO had already returned 44% by Tuesday. Now a couple of days of profit booking made these people come back screaming, as if they were personally invested in shorting Ola shares. People are stupidly comparing an EV manufacturer and now a lithium cell manufacturer, with service based startups like Zomato and PayTm and cosmetic retailers like Nykaa. They are even comparing an EV startup with other established ICE 2-wheeler manufacturers like Hero and TVS, to justify ""loss making company"". I guess people are just jealous of Bhavish or don't like his face. I think Ola is trying to grab hold of a couple of pretty lucrative sectors, such as EV and lithium cell manufacturing. With the entire world moving away from Chinese products, it's the right time for India to take that place. Ola is at least trying where it matters.

This is what my sister found in name of her father in law.,1jc1ca2,2025-03-15,660,"This is what ChatGPT answered: Based on the information provided, the share certificate from Reliance Enterprises Limited dated 6th January 1995 represents ownership of five equity shares with a nominal value of ₹1 each. Assuming that Reliance Enterprises Limited is the same entity as Reliance Industries Limited, these shares have undergone multiple stock splits over the years: 1. October 27, 1997: A 2-for-1 stock split. 2. November 26, 2009: Another 2-for-1 stock split. 3. September 7, 2017: A third 2-for-1 stock split. Each original share has thus been split into 8 shares (2 × 2 × 2). Therefore, the initial five shares have become 40 shares. As of March 18, 2025, the closing price of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) shares was ₹1,238.80 per share. Calculating the current value: Number of shares: 40 Current share price: ₹1,238.80 Total value: 40 shares × ₹1,238.80 = ₹49,552 Therefore, the current value of the original five shares, now equivalent to 40 shares, is ₹49,552.",miktyb2,ashi_sshhhhh,1,2025-03-19,RELIANCE.NS,9,0,True,3,Positive,Neutral,bullish,1,0
