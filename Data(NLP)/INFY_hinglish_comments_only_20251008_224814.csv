Why I gave up on active stock picking and sold every individual stock I own,piar0i,2021-09-05,610,"Anything too much is not good. When you invest in selective blue chip companies, you don’t need to track all the news every day or week. Your way is applicable more to small cap stocks than blue chips. Even a small negative news about blue chip stocks catch everyone’s attention and become a big news which you’ll come to know easily during your daily news headline reading. Also, many big companies are now much bigger and they find a way to tackle any big issues immediately. (E.g. HDFC bank, ICICI Bank, Infosys etc). You don’t need to dedicate separate time to track blue chips. But in the long run, the selected 10-12 biggies can beat index funds.",hbotsx5,TheGoalFIRE,20,2021-09-05,INFY.NS,1,0,True,2,Negative,Neutral,bearish,-1,0
"My grandparents have given me 20 lakh rupees, How should I invest?",p1jb09,2021-08-10,489,"Ten Lakhs in a Nifty tracking index fund. 5 year average annualised returns of 14.5%. Five lakhs in an S&P500 tracking index fund. Annualised returns of 10%. Two lakhs in the latest issue of Sovereign gold bonds. Always good to have some gold in your portfolio. One lakh as playing in the stock market money. Use this to buy and sell shares. Start with blue chips like Reliance, Infosys, Tata etc.. One lakh and fifty thousand in an FD as a liquid fund for emergencies. Fifty thousand as pocket money. Buy a good phone (though if you are the kind whose grandparents gifted 20 lakhs to, you'd already have a great phone), or invest in a good library. You are 18 years old and you are already wealthy beyond most people's dreams in India. For reference, the ransom amount in the film *Hera Pheri* was Rs 20 Lakhs. Use the money to improve yourself. Eat healthy, do not smoke or drink and exercise everyday. Within 20 years, you will realise the benefit of all three. When you are in the late 30s and start hearing news of your friends being diagnosed with diabetes and other lifestyle diseases, you will thank your 18 year old self.",h8drjug,conqueror_of_destiny,898,2021-08-10,INFY.NS,1,0,True,9,Positive,Positive,bullish,1,1
