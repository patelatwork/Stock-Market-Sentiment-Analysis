"PSA: Don't clutter your mind with chasing stupid cashback program, credit card offers, or privileged banking",n6xif1,2021-05-07,747,"I have 3 credit cards. 1. Amazon Pay ICICI : Free. All my Amazon shopping goes here and my go to card for my daily expenses because of the cbs . 2. ICICI Rubyx : Free - because it came bundled with my salary account. Highest credit limit hence keep this for emergencies before I could liquidate my savings. Also use this for Icici card benefits in flipkart that comes at times. 10 percent discount. Amazon pay icici was not giving 10 percent discount on Flipkart for whatever reason. There's also a discount on movie tickets I occasionally take advantage of. 3. Standard Chartered Super Value titanium : Free - because this came bundled with another salary account. Use this for all my fuel and electricity needs. Has 5 percent cashback on both and that's a steal deal. I've never crossed the credit limits in any of the above. Never missed a payment. Heck never even used them if I don't have cash in my account - I don't use and wait for salary to pay. I haven't spent a single rupee because there was a discount. I spent only what I would have spent anyways. And did I tell you, my primary spendings are from my cc for the last 5 years. Credit card is not all that bad it you use it right, honestly..but only a fraction of the cc users would have that attitude which is how the banks make money..and we make cash backs/points. Also, grab that credit card if it comes with your salary account. Edit : I added a fourth credit card : Flipkart axis bank credit card. Got it on lifetime free offer. Now this is my go to card because 1.5 percent cash back. Edit 2 : Adding Zomato card as well. Definitely help with my restaurant payments which is a major monthly expense for me. Edit 3 : Zomato credit card is useless going forward. They've cut down a lot on cashbacks. Cancelled this card. Edit 4 : Had saved about 5k with Zomato card before they tore it down. RBL offered me another useless card in Zomato card's place. I denied it. Have added Airtel axis card. This is my first paid card(sigh). 500 Rupees per year. But I use Airtel broadband and that gives me ~250 cb per month. 10 percent off on electricity bill, that would be 100 per month. 10% off on swiggy and zomato upto 500 per month. LPG Cylinder bookings go through this too but I get a cylinder once in like 5/6 months. So overall expecting to save ~400+ per month with airtel axis card.",gx9rc6e,melovemone,154,2021-05-07,BHARTIARTL.NS,3,0,True,5,Positive,Neutral,bullish,1,0
The tech narrative of Jio makes no sense.,gm7k7t,2020-05-19,473,"Great points. This is marketing schpiel that's good for inflating value in the short term. Same thing happened with WeWork - a real estate company priced like a tech company, and we all know how that worked out. Jio has done a fine job till now, but in smaller cities, their speeds are absolute gutter shit. I can't even video call my parents - I had to ask them to get Airtel connections on gunpoint. And tech-first companies like Flipkart and Amazon know how to build software - it's their bread and butter and they're not afraid to pay fresher devs and designers and supply chain people 20L straight out of college. There's only so much you can get out of your ""regulation chops"". If they can't deliver on basics like decent quality of service, they might find themselves closer to the Spice-Docomo end of the spectrum than the telco-VAS-electronics behemoth future they're envisioning.",fr29f2g,jawaharlol,39,2020-05-19,BHARTIARTL.NS,1,0,True,6,Positive,Positive,bullish,1,1
The tech narrative of Jio makes no sense.,gm7k7t,2020-05-19,473,"I disagree with the reason of jio domination. Telecom companies of India never did any innovation, never did any R&D, never invested in basic communication sciences. That’s why they got dominated by a company with just more money. JIO implanted IPv6 at largest possible scale, hired the best of engineering teams and in the initial days, purchased the best equipments from networking companies. OTOH, the airtel, Vodafone, telenor, Aircel, Docomo, they kept on investing money in marketing, sponsoring cricket series, making Bollywood richer, and relied on the cheapest labor on the ground and overly paid marketing people. Any company which follows this model can be easily dominated, just with money. My opinion is companies which don’t do innovation and spend on hardcore R&D should not exist in the first place. Such companies are liability on the economy, they have overly highly paid top management and the actual on ground workers at minimum wage. Such companies are disproportionately loud mouthed and always keep cribbing about talent or labor or infrastructure. Such companies are the ones which ask the government to pay salaries to their on ground workers in times of crisis, while their top management had wasted all the money on Bollywood stars or cricket stars.",fr4dzpe,lookingforjobinuk,10,2020-05-19,BHARTIARTL.NS,1,0,True,3,Positive,Positive,bullish,1,1
How Credit card alters your psche and punches hole in your finances,1eiutzf,2024-08-03,435,"This thread is full of people just talking about how credit card is bad while completely ignoring the fact that it's just you lack discipline and proper planning. Been using credit card for 8years , have never defaulted. Have always stuck to my expenses and can even track when I was overspending. It's a ""YOU"" problem not a ""Tool"" problem. If you know to use the tool properly, you will never have an issue. For example, we all pay for and use wifi at home. How many of you know that if you take Axis Airtel credit card while having an Airtel broadband connection, it discounts your wifi bill by 25% upto 250 a month ? You are gonna anyhow pay for wifi every month, no extra spending there. You are gonna pay that wifi bill through your credit card, no extra spending there. And you pay your credit card bill within the timeframe . What do you get from this other than benefits? The credit card has a 500 rs annual fee, you get 250 cashback every month. So without cc , 1000/month bill -> 1000x12 = 12000 With cc , 750/month -> 750x12 = 9000 + 500 fees = 9500. That's a savings of 2500 annually for literally using a cc to pay a bill. No default, one hassle , just benefit. Or take the amazon pay cc, any offline spend you do is 1% . Don't think like "" I have 5L limit on my card , so let me spend "". You should always forget the fact that you have a cc and just think you are spending via UPI . Your family wants to buy gold ? Go to the jewellers with the cash in your bank account, buy it via Amazon pay cc and then pay the credit card the very next day. No hassle and you get 1% cashback. What gives you 1% cashback on gold ? Hell if you are good , you can do it via amex and earn 5% or higher for the same. Credit card is a damn good tool, has its risks yes but also has its benefits. If you learn to use a credit card wisely and with discipline, you will only earn benefits. I do around 15-25k of UPI spends a month , I wallet load it through my credit card , do the same expenses through upi itself while parking that fund in a savings account earning interest . Stop blaming the tool, learn to use it wisely. Being 30+ and not having a credit card isn't bad. But being 30+ , not having a credit card and then confidently saying it's for the best cause you will only get hurt using a credit card shows you lack knowledge and most of all , you lack proper financial discipline. P.s I own 11 credit cards , have been doing this for 8 years and I maintain 790+ cibil score with 3% utilisation ratio. Also, if you travel for a foreign trip, cc is the safest method to carry money cause you have fraud protection.",lga3lch,Gunazor,4,2024-08-03,BHARTIARTL.NS,2,0,True,3,Positive,Positive,bullish,1,1
SEBI prefers investigating Hindenburg for insider trading instead of Adani for fraud,1e1bdmb,2024-07-12,383,"Dude majority major publicly traded organisation in India is run by a family who appoint their relatives in high position whether its Adani, ambani, tata, airtel, godrej etc do you really expect there's no insider trading happening at all. Its far easier to shoot the whistleblower than fix the problem.",lcx1meb,[deleted],3,2024-07-13,BHARTIARTL.NS,1,0,True,2,Negative,Positive,neutral,-1,1
