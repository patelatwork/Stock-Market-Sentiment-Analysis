How to save yourself from bank fraud and my experience with it.,1kfgmqm,2025-05-05,2241,"I am impressed by your knowledge. Good for you. I just wanted to share a really frustrating experience I had in the hopes that it might help someone else avoid the same. First off, I'm genuinely impressed by the knowledge some of you folks have on various topics. Seriously, good on you all for being so informed! Unfortunately, my own experience lately has been far less positive. About a year ago, I fell for a pretty elaborate online laptop buying scam and ended up losing a painful ₹34,000. It started innocently enough on OLX. I found someone supposedly from Nashik selling a secondhand laptop. We moved our conversation over to WhatsApp, and everything seemed legit at first. The payment was broken down into three parts: ₹1k, then ₹2k, and finally ₹31k. After I sent the initial ₹2k, the guy sent me a Blue Dart courier tracking ID. I actually went onto the Blue Dart website, and it showed a parcel had been created and received – which seemed to confirm everything. So, feeling confident, I transferred the remaining ₹31k. That same evening, the scammer went to the courier office, cancelled the parcel, and just kept both the laptop and my money. Unreal, right? Immediately, I contacted ICICI Bank's phone banking. They launched an ""investigation"" that dragged on for three whole months. In the end, their brilliant conclusion was that because I had confirmed the transaction with my bank PIN on GPay, there was nothing they could do. Basically, it was my fault for trusting the process. Not satisfied with that, I filed a cyber complaint. The police told me they needed the scammer's bank account number, but all I had was his phone number and Gmail ID. Needless to say, after a year of nothing happening, my cyber complaint was automatically closed. So, yeah. Neither ICICI Bank nor the cyber police were able to help me recover my money. It's incredibly disheartening and makes me think twice about any online transactions now. Just wanted to share my story as a cautionary tale. Be super careful out there, folks!",mqr0c1g,ajjuee016,7,2025-05-05,ICICIBANK.NS,4,0,True,6,Positive,Positive,bullish,1,1
Survived a Credit Card fraud today. Sharing my experience for an educational purpose.,p7cc6r,2021-08-19,1097,"Lucky you realised it soon. I had a similar experience around 2 years back. I had an ICICI Bank Credit card. The caller mentioned he was from the bank and was providing additional offers on my CC. The caller knew my name, CC no and everything seemd legit. Then came the CVV part in my case. Caller was like you do not need to tell your CVV on call for security purposes, just type it on your phone for verification. Wow, that was clever. I did not share the CVV obviously, but my credit card got blocked for suspicious activity. Had to call the ICICI helpdesk to get it unblocked. These people try to make it look as legit as possible. Never share CVV, OTPs.",h9j80nl,varuag07,2,2021-08-19,ICICIBANK.NS,3,0,True,2,Positive,Neutral,bullish,1,0
What are some of the investing lessons which you would like to share from your life?,l8xd80,2021-01-31,777,"I had been trading for over a month . My findings had been. 1. Never invest in penny stocks. There is high chance of them being operated by a circuit. They will buy stock in bulk and once stock gets into upper circuit sebi will reduce percentage for upper circuit from 20 percent to 10 percent, 5 percent and so on. Once they can show on chart this penny stock has gained 140 percent over a month. They will circulate this fake tip on whatsapp grp , telegram channels. Even big national daily like ET times will publish the stock name in top gainers and lot of people specially newbies fall for it and pay the price. Once large people put money these operators will pull back their money with sky high profits and crashing the stock. And since the stock has no real reason to rise again ur losses would be permanent. To add insult to injury lower circuit day after day wouldn't let u sell ur stock. 2. Never fell for tips given by research products like icici , CNBC or any others. These r all fluke no matter what they tell u. U can back test their prediction which they recommended one year ago. And check the current price of stock. You would get to know the truth , how their projected targets never reach the prediction. U would only loose money. 3. Intraday is not worth it. Focus on ur career. It's is more important. 4. If you really want to earn money from market either do swing trading . I myself made good money in it each time the sensex has crashed. The second option is do value investing. Buy stocks with good fundamentals that can become multi baggers. 5. Never do swing trading on midcap or anonymous stocks. Only buy sensex stocks on dip for it. Bcoz if u buy any random stock when sensex crashes there is no guarantee that stock will rebound once sensex roars again. 6. U should know it is important to cut losses as well. Sometimes u hold it for too long. But suppose a stock has fallen 50 percent and u r thinking it it will rebound some day . Let's not sell. Then u r wrong . This time this stocks needs to give 100% to get to original value instead of 50% . And even an index fund takes 5-7 yrs to double. So u can imagine holding to avoid losses can be wastage of time which when invested in some other stock would have given u actual profits. 7. Emerging technologies like prosthetic parts companies, AI companies and highly technical startups on Nasdaq can give u assymetric rewards . 8. This is for intraday traders and short term pigs and chickens. Don't trade too frequently. Only sell or buy when u r sure u can get more than 1% profit. Bcoz every time u buy/sell govt will deduct 0.2% and 20 would be ur trading charges. And if u include payment gateway charges as well. U r loosing money and wasting ur time which could be used productively in some other task.",gm8mgj6,ASHISH_AWESOME,1,2021-02-06,ICICIBANK.NS,1,0,True,9,Positive,Neutral,bullish,1,0
"PSA: Don't clutter your mind with chasing stupid cashback program, credit card offers, or privileged banking",n6xif1,2021-05-07,742,"There is an audience for which this might be true, but there are also plenty of people who are disciplined enough to make really good use of the card. I have two primarily - the Amazon ICICI (Like a lot of people here), I think it has genuine benefits - 5% cashback is real. That is like a 5% discount on almost all the stuff we buy. The other one is an HDFC Infinia, all family expenses are routed through that one, giving us plenty of points. I deliberately try and spend everything through that card to push up the billing amount, because of the points. Pre-Covid all our holiday flight tickets would come from those points. During Diwali we also give the kids spending money either at Croma or Shoppers stop via vouchers through these points. I never ever roll over the debt, pay it in full and a few days in advance. I even use Cred to make the payments and get a few rupees from Cred too :-) not to mention I was able to donate a zillion Cred points for oxygen last month. So, net net, I am saying these are very good instruments if you are able to use them well.",gxd3hec,pjathar,38,2021-05-08,ICICIBANK.NS,1,0,True,3,Positive,Positive,bullish,1,1
"PSA: Don't clutter your mind with chasing stupid cashback program, credit card offers, or privileged banking",n6xif1,2021-05-07,742,"I have 3 credit cards. 1. Amazon Pay ICICI : Free. All my Amazon shopping goes here and my go to card for my daily expenses because of the cbs . 2. ICICI Rubyx : Free - because it came bundled with my salary account. Highest credit limit hence keep this for emergencies before I could liquidate my savings. Also use this for Icici card benefits in flipkart that comes at times. 10 percent discount. Amazon pay icici was not giving 10 percent discount on Flipkart for whatever reason. There's also a discount on movie tickets I occasionally take advantage of. 3. Standard Chartered Super Value titanium : Free - because this came bundled with another salary account. Use this for all my fuel and electricity needs. Has 5 percent cashback on both and that's a steal deal. I've never crossed the credit limits in any of the above. Never missed a payment. Heck never even used them if I don't have cash in my account - I don't use and wait for salary to pay. I haven't spent a single rupee because there was a discount. I spent only what I would have spent anyways. And did I tell you, my primary spendings are from my cc for the last 5 years. Credit card is not all that bad it you use it right, honestly..but only a fraction of the cc users would have that attitude which is how the banks make money..and we make cash backs/points. Also, grab that credit card if it comes with your salary account. Edit : I added a fourth credit card : Flipkart axis bank credit card. Got it on lifetime free offer. Now this is my go to card because 1.5 percent cash back. Edit 2 : Adding Zomato card as well. Definitely help with my restaurant payments which is a major monthly expense for me. Edit 3 : Zomato credit card is useless going forward. They've cut down a lot on cashbacks. Cancelled this card. Edit 4 : Had saved about 5k with Zomato card before they tore it down. RBL offered me another useless card in Zomato card's place. I denied it. Have added Airtel axis card. This is my first paid card(sigh). 500 Rupees per year. But I use Airtel broadband and that gives me ~250 cb per month. 10 percent off on electricity bill, that would be 100 per month. 10% off on swiggy and zomato upto 500 per month. LPG Cylinder bookings go through this too but I get a cylinder once in like 5/6 months.

He's not trying to stop you from taking advantage of any of the great offers out there. I have done it before, spent too much time trying to figure out where i would get 12 rupees cashback instead of 10 on my 500 rupees recharge and just the mental energy it takes makes it not worth it. Because at the end these offers are meant to lure you in so the companies can charge you more later. Doesn't mean you shouldn't use credit cards or other offers. Pretty much everyone is buying stuff and paying bills online now, so something like the Amazon pay icici card is a great deal, but it's set up once and forget kind of thing. Get the card once and then just pay the bills you were already paying with it to earn free cashback. The advice is not for the people in the sub who are pretty responsible and pay all the bills in time. The point is not to get too stressed trying to find the right deals and coupons to the point where it affects your mental peace.

I convert them to Amazon Gift Cards and use them to buy smaller stuff. I just got myself a mouse and HDMI plug from these points. All I did was pay bills I already had to pay. Just used the card. Same with ICICI. To shop on Amazon I use that card. Get cashback on it. I would say it’s more of a choice on how sensible you are when you use your card.

How to see if a bank is risky for placing your deposits? [A guide from a banker],jwesme,2020-11-18,697,"Most Banks are still very far enough from any moratorium type position. It is unlikely that any big SFB or Bank will fail. So if you have money either in Bandhan, Ujjivan, AU or anybank which has to report numbers every quarterly it is unlikely that will fail, LVB was in trouble for a very long time, it has been no surprise that it was acquired by DBS. I also own a bank account which is in a smaller type of Bank(RBL) but for safety I have an alternate account in Kotak Mahindra. As long as you don't have a major amount of money in a corporate bank whose numbers you cannot find and the amount is north worth of 5 lakhs, I wouldn't worry about anything. In terms of safety, these banks are too big to fail as per RBI are SBI, HDFC and ICICI. A very important point to note is there has been no loss of depositors money in any of the bank failures and even in the unlikely event of a very big bank bank failing, it is unlikely the RBI or/and government will let it fail. A simple rule of thumb I use is keep atleast one bank account in one of the following banks - SBI, HDFC, ICICI and Kotak (in the order)",gcpw90h,GodofObertan,8,2020-11-18,ICICIBANK.NS,2,0,True,4,Negative,Neutral,bearish,-1,0

When you invest in selective blue chip companies, you don’t need to track all the news every day or week. Your way is applicable more to small cap stocks than blue chips. Even a small negative news about blue chip stocks catch everyone’s attention and become a big news which you’ll come to know easily during your daily news headline reading. Also, many big companies are now much bigger and they find a way to tackle any big issues immediately. (E.g. HDFC bank, ICICI Bank, Infosys etc).

US investing options for Indians - Personal experience,lpefwk,2021-02-22,463,"I think I can share my experience with Vested. I opened my account on January 2020. Back, then there was no fees to open account. * For Deposits - Initially there was no online transfer available. So, you need to fill some forms which can be downloaded and they will arrange you a pick up from bank to collect the form. You don't need to go to bank to submit the form. Bank will charge FX transaction fess which came around RS.2000 for me when I deposited $800 USD. Now, I believe online transaction is available if you have account with HDFC and ICICI. * For Withdrawals - Vested charges $11 + FX transaction fees from bank * For tax - To avoid getting taxed from both US and India there is some double tax avoidance agreement between US and India. Dividends which you get will get taxed in US and Capital gain(Long term/short term) will be taxed in India. For dividends, tax amount will be automatically detected from your account and only remaining amount will be deposited to your Vested account. Everything is clearly mentioned in transaction history. Then, from your vested account you can either withdraw it to your bank or keep re-investing in stocks. * For tax documents - They provide following documents pre-filled for each financial year. General Filings Summary, Foreign asset filing summary, Form 67 filling summary. * Support - So far had good customer support during account opening and for deposit. I opened this only for long term investment to mainly invest on ETFs like S&P500, US Total Stock Market Index, etc. and to invest on few tech companies which I personally like Apple, MFST, Google, Amazon, etc. Currently sitting at 35% unrealized gains.",gobiqgz,jaya1994,34,2021-02-22,ICICIBANK.NS,1,0,True,7,Positive,Neutral,bullish,1,0

I think paying 100 odd rupees to delay a 12,000 rupees expense over a year is a pretty basic tenet of financial literacy.

"Axis Bank has suddenly decided to raise its charges and minimum balance requirements to preposterous levels, what other bank do you suggest?",mj17s3,2021-04-03,419,"SBI is anyways a good choice in comparison to other public banks. I will however, add something which might not be relevant to this threa. Feel free to ignore it. I have 3 bank accounts: ICICI, Indian Bank (Allahabad Bank) and PayTM Payments Bank. I have a wealth account with ICICI so almost everything is free except for debit card fees. Indian Bank because I have a locker with them and PayTM Payments Bank because of FDs and very smooth payments experience. ICICI Bank is the oldest and in 19 years I have not faced any single issue. For me this is the primary account. Indian Bank is pathetic. Bad customer care, bad mobile app which never works and bad branch experience. PayTM Payments Bank is a delight and I keep only 1 lakhs (as it is the limit) for expense payments (UPI, NEFT, IMPS). ICICI bank does not charge for SMS yet (my wife has a normal savings account) but they do have 10K limit. Indian Bank has Rs. 500 limit and PayTM Bank is free except for debit card fees, if you want a physical card. I can vouch for ICICI and PayTM Bank as I never had a problem with them. ----------- These are the signs to come. All private banks will be increasing their service charges and decreasing their interest on savings instruments (heard it from a bank manager) as RBI has tightened the noose and has asked all banks to make digital payments free for all. The safest option right now, for someone who does not want to pay lot of charges, are public sector banks.

"PSA: don't procrastinate, buy term insurance before 30/11/21",qvsu68,2021-11-17,410,"I have been researching a lot about what term insurance to get for the past couple of weeks. Here are some pointers (backed by an excel sheet calculation) which might help you to make a decision. Writing from a perspective of 26/Male/NonSmoker/. Annual Income: 22LPA (PostGraduate) Policy Term: 40 Years (Till the age of 66) I have a STAR Health Insurance policy of Sum assured 5L which will in addition pay 5L on death/Permanent Disability. And a LIC Jeevan Anand which will pay 10L whenever I die. (Regret it though) Companies (should be) considered (in no particular order): HDFC Life, Tata AIA, ICICI Prudential and MAX Life. Go for a reputable brand. Once you're gone your beneficiaries will have to deal with getting the claim. Better the company, easier for them in the moment of grief. E.g. ICICI Prudential @ 26 years of age. 3 Cr - No riders - 40 Years - Regular Pay - Annual Premium \~25k. **Remember:** 1) Insurance is not an investment. 2) Account for inflation (5-6%) while choosing a policy cover. 1 Cr looks great as of now bur 15 years later it won't be sufficient. Choose a higher cover with affordable premiums. 3) Increasing Cover option is a good choice. Limited companies provide it. The cover increases by a fixed % every year till it is 2x the starting base cover. Premiums are fixed lifelong. MAX and Bajaj Allianz offer increasing cover options. (Policy Bazaar) 4) Don't confuse #3 with life-stage benefits in which you opt to increase the cover at marriage/kids and premiums also increase. TATA and ICICI offer Life Stage Benefits. (Policy Bazaar) 5) MaxLife is showing a 5% discounted figure for the annual premium on Policy Bazaar. Your yearly premiums from the 2nd year will be not discounted, so a bit higher. (Refer to the strike-through figure on MaxLife official website for the actual amount) 6) Use dummy data to explore the insurance aggregators and official sites to avoid spamming. (I made an official account 2 weeks later and got 4 property calls in 2 days) 7) You will come across 4 combinations of Term Life: a. Regular Pay means pay for the entire policy term. b. Regular Pay with Return of Premium means paying for the entire policy term and getting all the paid premiums back after the policy term ends, provided you're still alive. c. Limited Pay (5, 10, 12, 15 years) means to pay for a lesser/limited no. of years. The entire premium to be paid is reduced by 50%. (Some policies limit their rider benefits if you choose Limited Paym like ICICI) d. Limited Pay with Return of Premium. (NEVER consider) I'd suggest you outrightly reject everything except a. Considering purely from an economics and Time Value of Money PoV. The Return of Premium (RoP) makes no sense as the amount you'll get after the policy term will be not as valuable as compared to what it is today. The yearly premiums will shoot up by \~1.8x if opted for RoP mode. E.g. You pay 25k for 40 years i.e. 10L in total With RoP, you pay 45k for 40 years i.e. 18L in total. You pay 8L extra to get 18L back. Let's think about investing. If you invest 20k extra per year (1600 monthly SIP) in an index mutual find considering 10% RoR for the next 30 years. You'll make 35L. Double!! Consider LTCG taxes @ 10%, you're still good. The RoR is very conservative. You can fetch 12-15% too! So, you PAY LESS and INVEST the overhead. The Limited Pay option also makes lesser sense from the same PoV. This mode will shoot up your yearly premiums by more than 2x. Effectively, you would be paying less than 40-50% in total. But consider the yearly premium you pay today and the same yearly premium you pay 20/30 years later. The latter will be far easier, far smaller and far less valuable as compared to today. Firstly, the company wants you to pay as early as possible because the more amount they get now, the more they are able to invest. They understand money will lose value as time progresses and it'll be difficult for them to generate returns later on. Secondly, the company doesn't have to keep worrying to get the premiums for the next couple of decades. If you pay earlier and something happens to you in the 15th year of the policy term, it will be a win-win for them because they already have all the premiums. E.g. In regular pay, you pay 25k for 40 years i.e. 10L in total. With Limited Pay, you pay 55k for 10 years i.e. 5.4L in total. Looks good? Wait. 5.4L in next 10 years v/s 10L in next 40 years. So, you pay 30k extra for 10 years i.e. 3L more to reduce your premiums by 4.6L. in the next 10 years! Let's think about investing again! If you invest 30k extra per year (2500 monthly SIP) in an index mutual find considering 10% RoR for the next 10 years. You'll make 5.5L. Keep it going for the next 10-20 years. You make 56L! Consider LTCG taxes @ 10%, you're still better. 8) One more point that companies make is that the longer the policy term more the chances that you may face difficulties paying the premium (you might be short of funds later). But by basic disciplined investing as seen above you can generate enough amount to pay off your premiums for regular policy terms in a very easy way. They also say that in the long run, you might forget to pay off the premium. Even if you miss a premium paying year, the policy is as good as dead. Solution? Switch on Auto-Debit. 9) A limited pay exception might be the case where you can afford to pay and just want to be done with paying off the premiums to clear up liabilities. 10) After payment (online mode) there is a proposal form that needs to be completed for further processing. 11) Opting for the policy from an aggregator say Policy Bazaar looks good. They do help your kin during the claim process. IDK how efficient will they be? Another option is through the official website. And next option is third-party agents. 12) Always opt for YEARLY payment mode. 13) Different insurers cover different no. of critical illnesses in their Critical Illness rider. Tata(40), HDFC(19), Max(64/22 - Very expensive) 15) The Waiver of Premium rider's premium amount fluctuates when you change the life cover amount, paying term and RoP mode. The Critical Illness rider's amount remains the same with changing life cover amount. 16) Combining 2 different policies to achieve max. features and riders will ALWAYS cost more. It boils down to personal choice though. I hope that was helpful. Researched a lot so thought of sharing my 2 cents.

Whether one should have a credit card or not?,no4823,2021-05-30,412,"I believe that one should not get a credit card right after they start earning. Like me, early credit card users can be a victim of poor budget management. They’ll buy a nice phone on a six month no-cost EMI, then buy a cool gift for girlfriend/boyfriend on a three month no-cost EMI, and worship that credit card because of its power. Once they realize their budget planning is messed up, it will be too late. I couldn’t get out of poor budget management for more than a year, because I had a credit card from the beginning of my first job. If that was not enough, I added another form Amazon ICICI and things went south right after. It’s the spending habits that kill your game. I had bad spending habits. If you are reading this, and have bad spending habits, give your credit card to your mom/dad for a year and don’t use it.
