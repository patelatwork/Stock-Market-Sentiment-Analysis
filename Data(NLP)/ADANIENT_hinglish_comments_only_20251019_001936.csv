Sound logical to me,1d9jgr5,2024-06-06,5867,"Only real case I see here is an unregistered Investment Advisor, Modi (Amit Shah is actually a stock trader and may have an registration with SEBI), gave a stock advice. This falls under civil matter and Modi should be fined and banned from investing in both NSE and BSE. All the conspiracies of pump-dump scheme here is pure political thing. Remember, correlation is not equal to causation. In a pump-dump scheme, the stock that is actually a garbage, prices are inflated, and then insiders exit the company and let the retailer have the losses. In this case, the scenario resembles at the surface level. No way, Nifty 50 and Adani stock (I am mentioning Adani because it had the highest fall and then it jumped by 20 percent in last two days) could come back at the same pre-election prices within 2 days. Even on 3rd June, Nifty 50, despite hitting all time high, has relatively low PE value. That's not how pump-dump scheme works. In Harshad Mehta pump-dump scheme, for example, ACC remained low for whole decade after Harshad Mehta dumped it. Therefore, June 4 market crash could only be proven as panic selling. If anything, despite the smooth recovery of stock market, PE is still low and market is fairly valued. For long term investor like me, I am still putting more money in Nifty. I think the reason Rahul Gandhi made these claims because it is appealing to people and youth of lower strata of society that doesn't understand stock market or only learned about stock market through people like Vivek Bindra. Bro has already started preparing for the next election. Interesting. Edit: Can anyone share me the graph shown in video?

Tell me Why,1cupbtz,2024-05-18,3294,Because adaniji’s empire needs funding to grow na! How will he get loans from PSU banks otherwise? If you are a naive you’ll think psu banks should raise their own funds by the profits they make on their loans. But then how can the cronies pocket the psu loans then? So periodically the psu banks will not collect back enough loans (called NPA) instead the govt can fund them from their tax collections (called recapitalisation). Business model is simple: You earn -> pay tax -> govt will recapitalise psu banks with tax money -> banks will give loans to cronies -> cronies pocket the loan. How else do you expect people in power to earn? What even is the point of getting power if you can’t become filthy rich?,l4k9bw4,facelessredditer,16,2024-05-18,ADANIENT.NS,1,0,True,2,Positive,Neutral,bullish,1,0

Thus due to low supply and hype created in market share price goes up, which gives high valuation to adami , with this high valuation he will take loans from public banks and bond market to buy government companies at cheap rate (god knows why may be mudi kaka knows ). By having monopoly on government infra projects and bought companies he can continue to grow valuation and keep on buying more and more with debt and expanding.

Indian banks (PSBs so your money) and NBFCs and maybe some arab firms will lend at higher rates. The entire group's interest rates and collateralisation ratios just went up. From the indictment it also seems like the evidence is solid. These guys kept notes detailing not only the bribes paid, but also how much extra power each state would buy and how much that increases the per unit rate for the consumers of that power. They also made PPTs with ""smart wordplay"" to figure out how their US entity would route the bribe money to Gautam Bhai. A US jury that comprises common Americans who are already facing inflation, housing crises and unemployment will be asked to decide if a foreign billionaire is guilty of corruption. Then they'll see all this evidence. Adani can't even pull the insanely shady shit he does through our Home Ministry to chamkau our judiciary on the US grand jury because India-US relations aren't very great, and if we mess with their jury we'll have to deal with a wave of anti Indian outrage and a completely unpredictable President Trump for whom US public opinion matters more than any fake friendship with any Indian leader. I just hope they don't find more evidence proving the Madhabi Buch claims which also seem pretty true, because that will impact the credibility of the whole Indian economy as a good place to invest. The FII pullout is nothing compared to what will happen then. Indian Cos which aren't corrupt and stupid are the ones who will suffer. Every good Indian business will now find it that much harder to get capital. It is a national tragedy if our unicorns, start ups, existing largely non corrupt conglomerates and small businesses suddenly find it way harder to raise foreign capital or have to do so at a higher cost of borrowing. If I was Kamal Hassan in that movie where I became PM for a day, I'd have this dude tried and put in jail ASAP, fired Madhabi ASAP, have some big 4 law firm / accounting firm audit and give everyone else in SEBI at least a clean chit and finally had something happen to the guy to silence him in Tihar.

It's something **not unique to India** because it's done by every big corporation in the US, Europe, China, Japan, etc. Please read about Double Tax Avoidance Agreements, BEPS, Conduit OFCs, Sink OFCs, etc. There are **3 different generic structures** through which it could be done, namely: **A. Intellectual Property**: \*Most well-known, popular and scrutinized \*Companies which deploy this strategy include Apple, Microsoft, Meta(Facebook), Alphabet(Google), Netflix, etc. \*Read about Double Irish with Dutch Sandwich, Green Jersey, Patent Boxes, Single Malt, etc to know about the different IP-based BEPS tools and structures. **B. Debt:** \*Earning Stripping \***Allegedly deployed by Adani** \*It's also deployed by Pfizer, REITs, Investment Companies, Infra Companies, Hedge Funds, etc all over the world \* **It's legal just like short-selling** \* [Please watch this video]( to better understand the basic structure. **C.

If Adani fails then of course PSU banks will take the hit but retail investors will be saved to some extent. if not and people keep buying, well, another $GME scenario in Indian Market.",j6gyjww,gadafiwasgreat,-3,2023-01-30,ADANIENT.NS,2,0,True,4,Positive,Neutral,bullish,1,0

"Kyu Desh ki janta ka 70 hours juice nikalna he, don't they have children to get back to?",1c9auqr,2024-04-21,1572,"I don't care what you guys will think but I despise this Murthy Couple. Both Narayan Murthy and sudha Murthy always try to portray themselves as one of us by sharing stories of how she have not bought a Saree for last 20 yrs and so many humble deeds. Rarely heard self advertising humbleness more from anyone else other than them and some instagrammers doing charity. People finds Ambani, Adani less closer to us but reality is they are in different financial strata and they never try to hide or mask it. But not Murthys, even when they are major shareholder of a multi billion dollar company and in-laws of Prime minister of UK. For some reason I believe they are doing this PR to give their son in law's critics less pointers. If you check comments against Rishi Sunak, many will mention that her wife comes from a family of billionaires and so he will never be able to represent middle class people of UK. PR must have started these campaigns to keep criticism in check. Also own political ambition is now coming up as Sudha Murthy became nominated member of Rajyasabha.",l0qk00v,bubba-yaga,1,2024-04-22,ADANIENT.NS,1,0,True,4,Negative,Positive,neutral,-1,1
