The Masterplan Of Infosys !!,1gsq1jg,2024-11-16,5433,"Since nobody wants to argue the points I’ll try it. First of all Murthy has not much say in this. He left the company in 2011. For the sake of the argument let’s say he does. The real question is how is Infosys even able to hire graduates at this salary? This happens when there are no jobs in the country. Every large MNCs in India have starting jobs around that range even today and hasn’t changed in the last decade. The only reason Infosys and other companies are still getting away with it is because primarily there are people who are ready to work at those prices and conditions. And that’s because there are way too many engineers(1.5 mil each year) of below average quality because of poor education standards. And there are way too many engineers in IT sector because there are no good quality jobs in any other sectors of the country except IT so everyone does engineering(primarily CS/IT) but even non-IT degree students work in these companies. Too much supply very little demand. Just look at some college placements TCS, Info, Tech Mahindra hiring students in 1000’s as if they are in a Mandi and buying engineers in wholesale. Doesn’t matter what branch you are from. But why is this happening though? I thought the Modi govt created crores of jobs in the last 10 years acc to every BJ Party memeber and their voters? That’s the million dollar question for the BJ Party and their MP/MLA.",lxpcapa,Akihira_579,1,2024-11-18,TCS.NS,2,0,True,4,Positive,Neutral,bullish,1,0

New one again,1inn19b,2025-02-12,2461,"Well, L&T ECC did come to my college for job offers. The company is great, their work is great, but guess what they were offering to the fresh recruits??? The year was 2013 and the offer to the freshers was 2.8LPA as CTC! To the engineer graduates of NIT! This was pure evil. As during that time, even a comany like TCS and Wipro who used to hire from tier -III colleges, had CTC of 2.5-3.5 LPA, where the knowledge from the recruits was less demanding, while in L&T ECC, the knowledge required (Core Domain Knowledge) was auiet high. No wonder they must be paying very low to the labourers.",mcd0mc8,NightHawkShukla,5,2025-02-12,TCS.NS,2,0,True,3,Negative,Positive,neutral,-1,1

Means he can talk about the company but cant take any decisions. He already left the company in 2009 after the Nano project. His companies are headed by N. Chandrashekharn (Ex. TCS CEO). He makes all the strategic decisions. Also each company has its own Chairman & CEO. It's the largest private employer in India. Big companies have their inheritance and succeeding plans already documented, not after the person is not with us. Secondly, it's the employees & culture that drives growth.

Ola is the definition of a scum brand and it is the flag bearer of why Indian firms can never be world class. I am looking at all of you: Ola, Flipkart, Bajaj Finance, TCS, Infosys and so many others who think it is okay to exploit their workers as well as their customers while the people on top reap all the benefits. I am not saying that western firm's are faultless but at the very least they are at least a tiny bit more humane.

Indians hold 71% of H-1B visas - Trump's Rs 90 lakh fee hits them hardest. Is Trump Crazy ? Why He Hates India So Much ?,1nlw019,2025-09-20,1563,"""Push global talent elsewhere"" Lol, most of these H1B holders are Indian IT coolies from TCS, Infosys, Wipro. Some of them won't even find jobs in India for their skill set, some are useless middle managers who just warm the seat cushions. The actual talented folks are just 0.1% of all H1B visa holders. If anyone thinks all H1B visa holders are some talented top notch people, you are highly mistaken. Trump is putting the brakes on these skill-less IT coolies.
