"Let us all support TATA, such a caring and responsible group",1l9tuzw,2025-06-12,3581,"Tata is not the same it was decades back. They don't have ethics and values in the business anymore. 1. Tata motors - scam dealerships, pathetic service centres. Who can't service a car without a complaint. Been using the Tata car for last one year. Have multiple complaints , the complaint even went till sales head of Tata. But no one cares. Such a horrible company 2. Bigbasket - acquired by Tata couple of years. Is heading to massive amount of losses. It was doing fairly well before it acquired. They turn dead to variable pricing especially for veggies and fruits.. you ask for 1 kg tomato. They will provide 1.1 kg and bill you 10 percent extra. Every time I order I get 25-35 re excess bill. 3. Tata salt - linked to health issues. 4. TCS- worked in this pathetic company for 5 years. After infosys this is the worst company to work. They literally don't care what project they are bidding. They will do all gimmicks to get a project even from a smallest client for rockbottom prices Put all freshers in it slog for many hours . Until client loses patience. 5. Now the airlines. Despite several complaints . They remained deaf to customer. Shows lack of ethics values. All they want is money 6. 1mg - it used to do well before tata acquired. Now a complete dud. 7. Tata cliq - wonder why this portal even exist. Nothing exciting ni wide categories. It's just for the sake of having ecommerce platform 8. Tanishq - in the name of quality they charge 10-15 percent higher than market price They are solely living with Ratan Tata brand name. With he being no more. I think tata as a brand might fall apart. Remember even when it's a desi brand. Atleast for motors part. Most of their cars are designed by Jaguar engineers acquired by Tata. It's not made by Indian minds. Atleast Mahindra has Indian minds in designing their new cars. But Tata doesn't. CEO of Tata group Chandrasekaran. Shamelessly tells in press..we have resolved most of the service related issues with Tata cars .where harrier ev was getting released. Trust me I am part of 600 member group of Punch ev.. almost 80 percent of them have atleast one complaint which is not resolved by the service center. Even lost patience going to SC. We are resolving all small complaints by ourselves. They will try to portray they are pioneer of ev sector In actual they are trying to milk ev customers. Looks at the pioneer pricing for tata ev chargers . Almost 22-24 re per kw. Whereas govt had asked to set 11 during solar and 13 during non solar hours. They shouldn't call them pioneer. Other private CPO follows Tata.",mxi4u7j,BotherIntelligent291,1,2025-06-13,INFY.NS,1,0,True,5,Negative,Neutral,bearish,-1,0
