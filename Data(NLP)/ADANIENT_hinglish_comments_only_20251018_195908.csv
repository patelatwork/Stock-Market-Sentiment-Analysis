Whistleblower Documents Reveal SEBI’s Chairperson Had Stake In Obscure Offshore Entities Used In Adani Money Siphoning Scandal,1eoybro,2024-08-10,917,"I honestly had more respect for Hidenburg before they published the Adani V2. This new article doesn't have much meat, they make 3 key allegations **Claim #1**. SEBI did not investigate the Adani issue raised by Hidenburg in 2022 because the SEBI chairman had a conflict of interest. SEBI Chairman Buch invested \~10% of her networth (\~$860K of $10M) in a foreign fund that had links to an Adani director. This was done in 2015, 2 years before becoming the SEBI chair. She exited the fund in 2018. **Claim #1**: They say SEBI Chairman Madhabi Buch didn’t investigate Adani issues from the 2022 Hindenburg report because she had a conflict of interest. Apparently, she invested about 10% of her net worth (\~$860K of $10M) in a foreign fund linked to an Adani director back in 2015. She exited this fund in 2018, two years before becoming SEBI Chair. **My Take**: This seems like a weak argument. The investment was years before the first Adani report and before Buch even became SEBI Chair. Also, SEBI is a big organization; it’s not like every decision goes through the Chairman alone. This doesn’t really prove a conflict of interest. **Claim #2**: The report points out that Buch’s husband worked for Blackstone in 2019, a firm with big investments in REITs. Hindenburg argues that Buch, as SEBI Chair, was publicly supportive of REITs without mentioning her husband’s connection to Blackstone. **My Take**: This point doesn’t hold up well. Blackstone is involved in a lot more than just REITs, and Buch’s husband was likely hired for his procurement skills, not because of his firm’s REIT investments. If we apply this logic, any association with a company involved in real estate would be seen as a conflict of interest, which seems overblown. **Claim**: The report mentions that Buch and her husband are directors at a consulting firm that earned about 4.4 times her SEBI salary, which is around 2 crore in revenue. **My Take**: The allegation here isn’t very clear. If Hindenburg is suggesting some kind of kickback from Adani, there’s no strong evidence for that. Also, consultants with experience can command high fees, so a revenue of 2 crore doesn’t automatically imply wrongdoing. Consultants, like Buch's husband with years of industry experience, can charge upwards of $2K per hr. Getting \~150 hours of billable work in a year is not unreasonable. We havent had large report coming out on Adani after the Hidenburg v1. Had there been good meat/ allegation possible, investors would have crushed it. We've had investors taking short position and exposing scams in the domestic market (case in point - Manpasand beverage) Moreover, Hidenburg have included passport nos and contact details of Arun Chopra from IIFL - why couldn't they hide/ mask it? How can they be irresponsible with such PII in effort to expose a scam not related to Arun I dont know how market will react on Monday, but I see little real content in this new report",lhh671r,brandomised,10,2024-08-11,ADANIENT.NS,8,1,True,7,Positive,Positive,bullish,1,1

The matter deserves the attention of the apex court because the SEBI chairperson in January 2014 retired only in February 2017 and is currently serving as “Non-Executive Independent Director-Chairperson” of NDTV, which was acquired by the Adani group in 2022."" *Investigation Findings* The OCCRP investigation has further revealed that a UAE-based secretive firm named Excel Investment and Advisory Services Limited owned by Vinod Adani, brother of Gautam Adani and member of Adani promoter group, had received over $1.4 million in “advisory” fees from management companies of EIFF, EMRF and GOF between June 2012 and August 2014. The investigators have not only dug up invoices and transaction records, but also internal emails which suggest that EIFF, EMRF and GOF were investing funds into the Adani group stocks at the behest of Excel Investment and Advisory Services Limited, that is, Vinod Adani.

Adani suspected of fraud by selling low-grade coal as high-value fuel,1cxrs4g,2024-05-22,549,"I'm not sure why a thread on investments has to degenerate into politics, where the comments can be summarized as: Adani Bad = Modi Bad = India bad. Are there other points that may be relevant ? I am a former CEO (retired early). While I haven no connection with the Adani group or anyone in infrastructure, I've seen Gautam Adani from the days he was travelling on a scooter trading in plastics. His big break came when he set up Adani port (with a Cong Govt in Gujarat at the time) on what was then waste land. People thought he was nuts for setting up a port close to Kandla, which we then thought was the Gold standard in ports (Adani port turned out to be world class and we could see how bad Kandla or JNPT were by comparison, in for e.g. turnaround time of a ship). Just like Reliance's refinery he took a big audacious bet and created world class infra when there was no immediate need for it. That, for me, is a learning if one wants to get into infra. Most of the Adani projects after the current govt came to power are in states rules by the opposition. Vizhimgam port in Kerala had a anti Capitalist anti Adani, Communist govt of Kerala wooing Adani to run the port. There are also ports in Andhra, TN, Odisha and WB, which are opposition ruled. The point is that a big player in Infra has to be close to politicians on both sides (just as they are in the US). That \`closeness' will invariably involve a bribe, but the politicians bargaining power is less when there is no competitor (offering the same service at a similar price) and when voters want the infra provider (e.g. the state needs power and its SEB cannot supply it). Adani's competitor today is other private solar and wind projects, which will prevent Adani from making windfall profits from thermal power. If the power cost gets too high, industry will move to other states, or domestic consumers will complain. In power, the big gamble of Adani was importing coal, when the view in India was that India had plentiful supply of coal and imports were too costly. Profits came from owning the coal mine abroad, owning the port and the power plant that converts the coal into power. Extraordinary profit comes from all the other jugaad that promoters to - the most common example among Infra promoters is gold plating the project cost.

SEBI prefers investigating Hindenburg for insider trading instead of Adani for fraud,1e1bdmb,2024-07-12,382,"I think your understanding of insider trading is not correct. Insider trading is trading on a piece of information you got outside of official channels If you overheard and traded on it, it’s insider trading but you are unlikely to be caught because how many times will you overhear something like this Your one trade won’t trigger the checks. If you hear something many times like let’s say you snoop of Deloitte and everytime they audit a takeover deal, you overhear them, your trades will trigger an investigation as it’s odd that you can always be invested in a company that is a takeover target. In many jurisdictions your assets are frozen during the period they investigate you but to start an investigation they really have to have solid ground for suspicion I have known an account being frozen for just 3 insider trades, all happening in succession although the amount each trades was small There was also a case of an Australian data analyst releasing employment numbers to his friend a night before to trade in currencies where both went to jail. I know a personal friend that works for a bank that usually does mergers and acquisitions and he is not allowed to even have an equity account. My Indian brokerage personnel are not allowed to trade in their personal capacity. I don’t know about their families trading. A brokerage firm is very less likely to come in contact with insider information Basically as far as I know, when you get an information, you have the obligation to ensure the information is not an insider knowledge before you trade on it. How you acquired it will not be investigated. If you frequently traded in large sums and majority of your trades before news was officially released there is a strong likelihood that you traded on insider information unless you prove you haven’t. They don’t have to prove, you have to. Edit: irrespective of what sebi says as it has to prove it in court, analysing a companies balance sheet based on public information and trading on it or sharing it with someone who trades on it, can’t be insider info !",lcy2fol,Ok_Medium9389,1,2024-07-13,ADANIENT.NS,0,1,True,4,Positive,Neutral,bullish,1,0

Of course, if one wants to go bring and snags a tie up, say with the Govt and,or any major EV manufacturer (say TATA/OLA/Mahindra) to set up infra in a large area, say a metro city. This may have a chance of eventually making some money. Given the absence of a firm battery swap mechanism, one needs large real estate AND this eliminates the possibility of centralizing recharging which in turn implies that commercial electricity connections need to be set up on each site (i.e transmission lines/transformers to be setup etc.) Eventually, this space will probably end up with a copule of biggies , say Adani/Reliance/Ola setting up a pan India presence in collaboration with the Govt.
