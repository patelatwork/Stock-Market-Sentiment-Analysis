Sell time? Big win,1ije1ho,2025-02-07,407,"Don't create such concentrated portfolio. Include more stocks into your portfolio. As consumption is the focus of the govt, so you can buy stocks like HUL, Nestle, Zomato, Swiggy, HDFC, etc. Or better if you can't figure out stocks to buy, then go for ETFs like Niftybees, ITBees, Momentum50, SmallCap, etc.",mbetiie,TheoryShort7304,-1,2025-02-07,HDFCBANK.NS,1,0,True,3,Positive,Positive,bullish,1,1
Zerodha's market share is shrinking?,1b2wx2h,2024-02-29,338,"Doesn't really matter. Grow doesn't have serious traders for now. Mostly 18-25 with an avg. Account value of 50k-1lakh. Zerodha has the fat money guys. They pay more brokerage in a year than the avg. Account value of grow. So for now zerodha is a much more lucrative business . Having said that, this 18-25 year will grow up in the next 10 years and obviously can invest more. That's a positive but grow's UI and the whole vibe doesn't give serious broker vibes. I think they will eventually move towards zerodha, angle one, kotak/hdfc securities. The sum of money will grow and the seriousness will also grow.",kspf2qo,tathagatachaudhuri,1,2024-02-29,HDFCBANK.NS,1,0,True,4,Positive,Positive,bullish,1,1

Want to invest 3 lakhs in stocks. Need help!,1jd9rf2,2025-03-17,120,"Opinion: I think go all in on HDFC Bank. -One of the best managed Banks in the world (not just India). - Profits have more than doubled in last 4-5 years but share prices have not reciprocated - Deep under valuation in Private Banks - One of the biggest beneficiaries of the India story. If you don’t concentrate your capital, you won’t be able to build wealth. Now to take such large positions you need to have conviction, conviction comes from Knowledge and experience. Experience in understanding business, valuations and market cycles. So yes, HDFC Bank Ltd- all in :)",mi9e0lc,Heisenburg4,-8,2025-03-17,HDFCBANK.NS,4,0,True,4,Positive,Positive,bullish,1,1

what happend? how will i get the bonus shares?,1n0bw4x,2025-08-26,86,Bonus share is more beneficial for the long term as the number of shares increases but your investment does not change. Example: HDFC CMP is 2000 and Bonus of 1:1 is given now if you have 1 share the number of shares would be 2 but the CMP would be 1000 now. The benefit in the long term is that you more shares and when the company gives dividend it is given on per share.,napis60,virat1807,18,2025-08-26,HDFCBANK.NS,1,0,True,3,Positive,Positive,bullish,1,1
