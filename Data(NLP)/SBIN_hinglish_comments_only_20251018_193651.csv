Survived a Credit Card fraud today. Sharing my experience for an educational purpose.,p7cc6r,2021-08-19,1093,"I personally believe that the scammers get the data in bulk through lower tier data entry operators in banks. These people are paid 10k as monthly salary and then given personal details of lakhs of customers. Having worked in a bank, data security is not of paramount importance within its walls tbh. So these people sell the data t maybe 5 paise per person's data or maybe even 10 paise. Selling 10,000 persons' data would fetch anywhere from 500-1000 bucks and its free money. With almost no risk. And even if they get caught they are just fired since banks don't want the data leak to be public information. When I took a SBI CC i got a call almost one week later wherein a lady said that I had pending sign up offers and that my CVV needs to be shared. She had my details down to a lick including current card limit. I refused. Thereafter i blocked international transactions. Immediately after that there was a similar call asking me to share OTP for some credit limit increase. Its like they were aware that my international transactions were blocked.

Survived a Credit Card fraud today. Sharing my experience for an educational purpose.,p7cc6r,2021-08-19,1093,"I think not sharing the OTP saved you a lot of money and mental harassment. Victims get communication from fraudsters impersonating NBFC employees and offer loans or credit enhancement limits with just a phone call. Once you call the number, the fraudsters either ask you to fill privy financial details or share OTP or PIN details, resulting in loss of money. These days, credit card frauds are becoming so rampant and especially post COVID, people are playing on the vulnerabilities of the ones that have been affected financially. Increasing credit limits and offering free credit cards with no processing fee are ways to lure people into giving away money. My knowledge on fraud awareness by **Bajaj Finserv** and SBI also tells me that scam types include blocking the card if you don’t perform an action, threatening to suspend accounts, counterfeit and skimming frauds, honestly, the list is endless. I had received an email asking me to click on a link to update my KYC details or my no-cost EMI card from them would be blocked. Fortunately, I remember having updated all my information with my bank and no further checks were pending. I contacted my bank rather than responding to the email and was told everything was ok and no action was pending from my end. In fact your experience reminded me of an article that I happened to go through [ I often follow these tips since I have heard of so many near and dear ones become victims of fraud.",hh7snbw,shifalisharma1,1,2021-10-19,SBIN.NS,1,0,True,3,Negative,Positive,neutral,-1,1

It is good that you were aware and became suspicious that the call was a fraud. But everyone is not that lucky. Many people have fallen prey to the tactics of these fraudsters and have lost their precious money. So never share your OTP with anyone. Even if someone from your bank calls you and asks for your OTP, be wary. You never know that it is a genuine person or fraudster, as we have seen in this post.

This is a big risk factor to consider when you want to buy a bond. For example, the SBI 9.99% bonds which are very popular have a call option in the third week of March; should they call them back, your actual YTM will be much lower than what you would have thought [ is a great site to look at bond details in a single place.

Ex: My two cards, SBI and ICICI Amazon give me points/cashback. I use SBI to pay bills in restaurants, swiggy or any other monthly bills I’ve got to pay for my house. That helps me earn points. I convert them to Amazon Gift Cards and use them to buy smaller stuff. I just got myself a mouse and HDMI plug from these points. All I did was pay bills I already had to pay. Just used the card. Same with ICICI. To shop on Amazon I use that card. Get cashback on it. I would say it’s more of a choice on how sensible you are when you use your card.

How to see if a bank is risky for placing your deposits? [A guide from a banker],jwesme,2020-11-18,700,"Most Banks are still very far enough from any moratorium type position. It is unlikely that any big SFB or Bank will fail. So if you have money either in Bandhan, Ujjivan, AU or anybank which has to report numbers every quarterly it is unlikely that will fail, LVB was in trouble for a very long time, it has been no surprise that it was acquired by DBS. I also own a bank account which is in a smaller type of Bank(RBL) but for safety I have an alternate account in Kotak Mahindra. As long as you don't have a major amount of money in a corporate bank whose numbers you cannot find and the amount is north worth of 5 lakhs, I wouldn't worry about anything. In terms of safety, these banks are too big to fail as per RBI are SBI, HDFC and ICICI. A very important point to note is there has been no loss of depositors money in any of the bank failures and even in the unlikely event of a very big bank bank failing, it is unlikely the RBI or/and government will let it fail.

I found this solid PPF advice and want to share with this community,1lsg1ha,2025-07-05,493,"To all the peeps who might not know and to addon to OPs post - Tip 1: You don’t add money in PPF, when it’s about time to submit investment forms ( Jan - Mar) but instead deposit it in start of financial year I.e. April so that you can get interest for the full year. Tip 2: This is super wisdom 🦷 tooth - never make the mistake of transferring funds on 1 Apr. 1 Apr is bank reconciliation day and amounts are returned back. This may go unnoticed specially if it’s a bank like SBI and leads to a penalty if not reinitiated. Tip 3: You can make a partial withdrawal, if needed for an emergency 🆘 however, you must not default on yearly payment. I.e. every year you must make a deposit of atleast Rs 500 but don’t make the mistake of skipping putting money in a financial year Tip 4: This may not be true now because tax regime has changed but 1.5L is the total tax benefit one could claim in old regime for general savings .. so rather than putting money in different baskets or claiming deduction from various sources, it’s best to put the full 1.5 L at one go to your PPF in Apr itself. This helps to make a huge difference in interest that you are going to earn..and your corpus is secure at one place.",n1iprly,CreativeArtist01,111,2025-07-06,SBIN.NS,1,0,True,3,Positive,Positive,bullish,1,1

I will however, add something which might not be relevant to this threa. Feel free to ignore it. I have 3 bank accounts: ICICI, Indian Bank (Allahabad Bank) and PayTM Payments Bank. I have a wealth account with ICICI so almost everything is free except for debit card fees. Indian Bank because I have a locker with them and PayTM Payments Bank because of FDs and very smooth payments experience. ICICI Bank is the oldest and in 19 years I have not faced any single issue. For me this is the primary account. Indian Bank is pathetic. Bad customer care, bad mobile app which never works and bad branch experience. PayTM Payments Bank is a delight and I keep only 1 lakhs (as it is the limit) for expense payments (UPI, NEFT, IMPS). ICICI bank does not charge for SMS yet (my wife has a normal savings account) but they do have 10K limit. Indian Bank has Rs. 500 limit and PayTM Bank is free except for debit card fees, if you want a physical card. I can vouch for ICICI and PayTM Bank as I never had a problem with them. ----------- These are the signs to come. All private banks will be increasing their service charges and decreasing their interest on savings instruments (heard it from a bank manager) as RBI has tightened the noose and has asked all banks to make digital payments free for all.
