The Masterplan Of Infosys !!,1gsq1jg,2024-11-16,5433,"Since nobody wants to argue the points I’ll try it. First of all Murthy has not much say in this. He left the company in 2011. For the sake of the argument let’s say he does. The real question is how is Infosys even able to hire graduates at this salary? This happens when there are no jobs in the country. Every large MNCs in India have starting jobs around that range even today and hasn’t changed in the last decade. The only reason Infosys and other companies are still getting away with it is because primarily there are people who are ready to work at those prices and conditions. And that’s because there are way too many engineers(1.5 mil each year) of below average quality because of poor education standards. And there are way too many engineers in IT sector because there are no good quality jobs in any other sectors of the country except IT so everyone does engineering(primarily CS/IT) but even non-IT degree students work in these companies. Too much supply very little demand. Just look at some college placements TCS, Info, Tech Mahindra hiring students in 1000’s as if they are in a Mandi and buying engineers in wholesale. Doesn’t matter what branch you are from. But why is this happening though? I thought the Modi govt created crores of jobs in the last 10 years acc to every BJ Party memeber and their voters? That’s the million dollar question for the BJ Party and their MP/MLA.",lxpcapa,Akihira_579,1,2024-11-18,INFY.NS,2,1,True,4,Positive,Neutral,bullish,1,0

The Masterplan Of Infosys !!,1gsq1jg,2024-11-16,5433,"I feel one at an entry level job at Infosys should put in 70 hours of ""work"", if they want to accelerate their career. The time you spend working on yourself will take you to a higher skill tier. Do justice to the project assigned, just a teeny-tiny little more than expectations, enough to keep you from being fired, and get an above-average appraisal. Spend the rest of the time upskilling so that you can negotiate a larger pay at the same job, or switch jobs along with a ""promotion"" in position maybe to a product based company. One needs to work very hard, if they want to generate serious wealth, especially in their 20s and 30s.",lxjsljz,adarshBalak13,1,2024-11-17,INFY.NS,1,1,True,2,Positive,Neutral,bullish,1,0
The Masterplan Of Infosys !!,1gsq1jg,2024-11-16,5433,"I'm in no support for low wages, but the question you should be asking is, why does everyone in India want to have a job and work there. - if the person / individual is capable, there are various other methods to generate higher revenue, speaking in relative terms and currency conversation to Indian rupee. With great skills on Fiver and other places, once can show projects and skills, and generate better income with more healthy balance and work that they enjoy. Now if you were to tell me, the person is not capable of doing that, then not sure who to blame here. In India, every other kid can code and is an engineer, but those are book smart engineers who do not have the skills to do any project. Even in USA / Canada, those engineers would be stuck in entry side jobs with basic debug and data entry in the same of coding and paid just above minimum wage.

lil bro works 90 hours/week,1bhorm6,2024-03-18,1894,"His money, his choice.... He just spoke his opinion on 70hr/week. Nobody is forcing you to work 70hr/week. Can we just move on from this? He said this because he worked 70hr/week during his working days to start Infosys that went on to employ and made careers of thousands of people. Hence as per his experience, 70hr/week makes sense. His opinion on 70hr/per week may be taken in the wrong way. He is not saying to work 70hrs just for your employer. He is asking to carve out few hrs per week for 70hrs to work on your skills and knowledge. This completely makes sense. Let me tell you, IT is not the only job in the world. There are professions that already demand 70hrs/week work. Police constables on duty, doctors on duty, CAs, sales people achieving their target, our soldiers, field workers work more than their stipulated time. Also roadside vendors like Pani Puri wala, Momo sellers, Tea sellers, Idli/Vada sellers etc all open their stalls early in the morning and close late hours. Don't understand what's wrong with it??? Yes it's common sense, we need to work extra hours to achieve our goals. If you don't want, it's your choice. Nobody forced you. Why to hate someone?? If you are really pissed off with this guy, I have a better idea, Just leave your job or shut down your business and let's open a new IT company named ""Infosys 2.0"" and employ 2.5 Lakh people with revenue in billion dollars. Can you do it??? If not then shut the F up. Its easy to pinpoint someone on social media because Its free🤣 But very difficult to tell me in front of him.
