Can anyone provide suggestions,1m9ltkk,2025-07-26,109,My small suggestions to you. 1. For the amount you have invested no of shares are too high. Reduce them to Max 10 2. Now you have to understand that the higher amt invested in SBIN is not resulting in gr8 return if that money invested is more than a year 3. For example that amt invested in eternal would have overall lifted your portfolio. 4. If say company is worth 1 crore and you have invested say approx 10 lakhs in it. so you own 10% of the company and you are going to sell in profits only. so that no of shares are not trading in the market. And if you buy another 10 lakh worth of shares now you own 20% so driving the value of that company. for me I have my own way of investing strategy in equities. If you want to know im happy to share.,n58c8u7,andy_shipmyapp,3,2025-07-26,SBIN.NS,3,0,True,10,Positive,Positive,bullish,1,1
Thank you for your recommendations.,1jayby7,2025-03-14,86,Many congratulations for making a comprehensive portfolio. 👏 A few shares doesn't make any sense. 1. Why don't you have Reliance in your portfolio? 2. You purchased IndusInd Bank but not SBI or ICICI. Why? 3. Why Lupin & Cipla and not Sun Pharma?,mhyhmpp,Swimming-Werewolf353,0,2025-03-15,SBIN.NS,1,0,True,2,Positive,Positive,bullish,1,1

Hesitant to add more. Should I sell SBI?,1nktsds,2025-09-19,79,"You bought SBI at 203.25, and right now the stock is trading around 860 rupees, which means a very good profit so far. SBI is a very strong bank with a solid market position in India, and its earnings have been growing steadily. The stock recently hit its highest level of the year and is close to its all-time highs, showing that investors are confident. However, since the price is already quite high compared to when you bought, if you are feeling hesitant to add more, it could be a good idea to sell some shares to book profits safely. You can still keep some shares if you believe in the bank’s long-term growth, but reducing your exposure now will protect you if the price corrects in the short term.",nfk7c3m,Stockmarketistheway,2,2025-09-22,SBIN.NS,2,1,True,8,Positive,Positive,bullish,1,1
