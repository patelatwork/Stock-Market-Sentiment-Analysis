Customer is the king,1geq0rj,2024-10-29,2386,"Again a no-context useless post but here's an explanation again: This is completely a false rumor created by many Twitter handles and the press. Let me explain this in two scenarios: 1. Telecom operators are large companies with business operations across India and some in Africa and Asia. They are not going to reverse the tariffs just because BSNL added subscribers for two consecutive months and they lost subscribers. They don't care unless the numbers are very large and the trend continues for 8-10 months. They will remain silent because they know that eventually, people will have to accept the tariffs. And in the worst-case scenario for BSNL, the users that private telcos lost to BSNL might come back slowly when many realize the network comparison between BSNL and Airtel, Vi, and Jio. 2. Most importantly, the telcos, through COAl, have clearly stated that they will consider reversing the recently raised tariffs only if the government introduces some favorable policies, especially reducing the license fee from the current 8% to 0.5% to 1%. It is extremely shameful for the handle to post something as critical as this without any source or valid claim. As I said, telcos will only reverse the tariffs if those two scenarios occur, especially the second one.",lubvet3,sadsandwich__,4,2024-10-29,BHARTIARTL.NS,1,0,True,3,Negative,Neutral,bearish,-1,0

Customer is the king,1geq0rj,2024-10-29,2386,"BSNL added 25.3 lakh users in August. The company had gained 29.3 lakh subscribers in July.

"If BSNL starts giving speed like Airtel and Jio, then it's game over for both of them.",1gd4quo,2024-10-27,2127,"I think this trend will continue until October. Watch how most of the users who switched to BSNL come back to Airtel, Jio, and Vi. Many users have shifted just because of the price and are now suffering with little to no coverage and 2-5 Mbps of speed. BSNL has not even deployed 100,000 towers. It's not going to be easy for BSNL to start competing, especially with Reliance and Bharti. If you have observed the TRAI data, there has been a loss of 0.92 million net subscribers. Reliance has added VLR (active subscribers), and except for BSNL and Bharti Airtel, no one added 3G, 4G/5G subscribers, respectively.",ltz5gdy,sadsandwich__,1,2024-10-27,BHARTIARTL.NS,5,1,True,2,Negative,Positive,neutral,-1,1

"If BSNL starts giving speed like Airtel and Jio, then it's game over for both of them.",1gd4quo,2024-10-27,2127,I read in News somewhere that 6G is reserved for BSNL as they hd given ample opportunities for pvt sector in 5G. The govt said in that news --- they r developing indigenous tech for the same. As a result self reliance wld be attained and in order to compensate for the losses that BSNL faced due to old tech. Even govt knows telecom is an important asset and cannot be on sale so easily. The same reliance can even see a downfall in telecom business...... initially it hd seen a downfall..... unlike airtel where hd hardware business with them and they expanded to few countries as a result. Thing is our nation requires uniformity in OFC network instead of hvg different lines altogether. The same telephone exchange can house such tech for all the players and ensure a level playing field. BSNL can even earn some money by housing them inside. Do correct me if any.... but the news what i hd heard is for sure.,lu2ho51,[deleted],1,2024-10-28,BHARTIARTL.NS,1,1,True,2,Positive,Neutral,bullish,1,0
