"Ain't a fan of this guy, but these are facts !!!",1gmhy83,2024-11-08,6221,"Corporate hair cut is a nonsense term coined by journalist activists. If someone has defaulted on loans ofcourse there will be difficulty in gaining the entire loan amount back. The creditors and outside players get a chance to bid for the company and its won through a proper bid. How will you recover 100% from the company if it has gone bankrupt? It's not a gift of corporate hair cut given to the promoter, rather it is gaining back whatever the creditors and lenders can gain out of a lost cause. The fact that the banks are compulsorily required to report NPAs and not keep covering them forever has helped in reducing the defaults. Otherwise banks could have kept on lending more and more funds to a defaulter. This NPA reporting stops a debt spiral in the earliest possible stage.",lwg4rvz,vashah02,1,2024-11-10,RELIANCE.NS,1,0,True,3,Negative,Neutral,bearish,-1,0
The Masterplan Of Infosys !!,1gsq1jg,2024-11-16,5439,"Since nobody wants to argue the points I’ll try it. First of all Murthy has not much say in this. He left the company in 2011. For the sake of the argument let’s say he does. The real question is how is Infosys even able to hire graduates at this salary? This happens when there are no jobs in the country. Every large MNCs in India have starting jobs around that range even today and hasn’t changed in the last decade. The only reason Infosys and other companies are still getting away with it is because primarily there are people who are ready to work at those prices and conditions. And that’s because there are way too many engineers(1.5 mil each year) of below average quality because of poor education standards. And there are way too many engineers in IT sector because there are no good quality jobs in any other sectors of the country except IT so everyone does engineering(primarily CS/IT) but even non-IT degree students work in these companies. Too much supply very little demand. Just look at some college placements TCS, Info, Tech Mahindra hiring students in 1000’s as if they are in a Mandi and buying engineers in wholesale. Doesn’t matter what branch you are from. But why is this happening though? I thought the Modi govt created crores of jobs in the last 10 years acc to every BJ Party memeber and their voters? That’s the million dollar question for the BJ Party and their MP/MLA.",lxpcapa,Akihira_579,1,2024-11-18,RELIANCE.NS,2,0,True,4,Positive,Neutral,bullish,1,0

I have traveled pretty much through out 4 states ! From Goa to Kanyakumari to Pondicherry to Mysore to Bangalore to Madurai etc. ! The car is best for site seeing!

People didn’t wanted to be seen in nano or sit in one for some kind of weird reason i can’t point Any Bike or activa felt more superior than nano I guess it was the looks and nothing to do with cheap Indians are all for cheap and value products people jumped in to buy 251 freedom phone Sir’s idea was brilliant and its sad that it didn’t become the best seller .

Rajiv Bajaj response to 90 hour work week debate.,1hy8ej7,2025-01-10,4247,"![gif](giphy|6P5jz9bWjCPyIUJQec) Here's a roast to Murthy and Subramanyam from ChatGPT: # Roast Alert! 1. **The Eternal Grindstone Innovators:** * Narayana Murthy's pearls of wisdom suggest that India should compete globally by grinding its workforce into oblivion. Perhaps he forgot that innovation often comes from balanced, rested minds—not from people delirious from lack of sleep. * Subrahmanyan chiming in with Sunday work? Genius. Nothing screams ""build a robust economy"" like turning weekends into weekdays. Because who needs family time, hobbies, or a life? 2. **The Marathon Managers:** * Of course, asking **everyone else** to work 90 hours a week is easy when you're comfortably perched in a boardroom sipping chai. Why not first set an inspiring example? A **""proof of concept"" plan**, if you will. # Sarcastic Proposal Let’s take this *revolutionary idea* and refine it further: 1. **Top-Down Leadership Excellence:** * Start with the **top management**—yes, the **C-suite executives**, including Mr. Murthy and Mr. Subrahmanyan. They should *walk the talk* and consistently clock 90+ hours per week for **4–5 years straight**. No breaks, no Sundays off, and definitely no ""strategy retreats."" Only then can we assess whether this brilliant idea is sustainable. 2. **Trickle-Down Productivity:** * After 5 years of proving this concept at the top, bring it down to the **middle management**. Let's see if they too can survive and thrive with such inspiring leadership. * Finally, after decades of *proven results,* this visionary system can *gracefully trickle down* to the **entry-level workers.** Because why ruin everyone’s life at once when you can do it one level at a time? 3. **Leadership Role Models:** * Perhaps Mr. Murthy and Mr. Subrahmanyan could livestream their 90-hour workweeks for educational purposes? Watching them slog it out might just motivate the workforce—or serve as a cautionary tale. # Reality Check * Productivity isn’t about working endlessly; it’s about working smart. Burnt-out employees don’t innovate or thrive; they quit. Japan's infamous ""karoshi"" (death from overwork) comes to mind, but hey, maybe that’s the next inspiration for ""global competitiveness."" So here’s to **executive-level proof-of-concept testing.** Gentlemen, we’re eagerly waiting to see you redefine ""grind culture"" with your *untiring dedication!*",m6fssmt,Taydman1981,2,2025-01-10,RELIANCE.NS,1,0,True,3,Positive,Positive,bullish,1,1

The companies are probably paying them to put things there. Cred is how I got introduced to companies like Jimmy, Jade Forest, Litt Chocolates etc. I have also used their FD and loan too. I don’t think there is another pure India startup other than Zomato, Swiggy which gets used as much as Cred. They can easily get profitable if they stop blowing money on Ads and trim their team.

This is the big one,1gw3ijo,2024-11-21,1982,"This is a lot worse than we all think. Not just for Adani and his group but for the entire Indian economy and the credibility of our businesses globally. The group will now get blacklisted by Wall St and since the City of London closely follows their lead, by them too. Once that happens a large part of the global money market is closed. Indian banks (PSBs so your money) and NBFCs and maybe some arab firms will lend at higher rates. The entire group's interest rates and collateralisation ratios just went up. From the indictment it also seems like the evidence is solid. These guys kept notes detailing not only the bribes paid, but also how much extra power each state would buy and how much that increases the per unit rate for the consumers of that power. They also made PPTs with ""smart wordplay"" to figure out how their US entity would route the bribe money to Gautam Bhai. A US jury that comprises common Americans who are already facing inflation, housing crises and unemployment will be asked to decide if a foreign billionaire is guilty of corruption. Then they'll see all this evidence. Adani can't even pull the insanely shady shit he does through our Home Ministry to chamkau our judiciary on the US grand jury because India-US relations aren't very great, and if we mess with their jury we'll have to deal with a wave of anti Indian outrage and a completely unpredictable President Trump for whom US public opinion matters more than any fake friendship with any Indian leader. I just hope they don't find more evidence proving the Madhabi Buch claims which also seem pretty true, because that will impact the credibility of the whole Indian economy as a good place to invest. The FII pullout is nothing compared to what will happen then. Indian Cos which aren't corrupt and stupid are the ones who will suffer. Every good Indian business will now find it that much harder to get capital. It is a national tragedy if our unicorns, start ups, existing largely non corrupt conglomerates and small businesses suddenly find it way harder to raise foreign capital or have to do so at a higher cost of borrowing. If I was Kamal Hassan in that movie where I became PM for a day, I'd have this dude tried and put in jail ASAP, fired Madhabi ASAP, have some big 4 law firm / accounting firm audit and give everyone else in SEBI at least a clean chit and finally had something happen to the guy to silence him in Tihar.

Peter Navarro got Exposed by Musk’s X!!!,1naidic,2025-09-07,1690,"Adam Tooze had an interesting take on his podcast Ones and Tooze - India and Tennis > And it didn't use to habitually buy any oil from Russia. Why would it? Like it's across the Indian Ocean from the Gulf. Like that's where, you know, Indian migrant labor goes to work is in the Gulf. Like why would you buy any oil from Russia? But the entire logic of the sanctions regime has formally understood by everyone who was doing it was precisely the double win of putting a cap on oil prices globally to hurt Russia and enabling the biggest poor buyer in the world, which was India, to go shopping at bargain prices for this oil, which Russia couldn't sell to global markets any more than the cap. **And the whole idea was to divert Russia oil to the most needy and strategically important buyer, which was India currying favor with the Indians, helping to build the quad alliance against China whilst objectively hurting Russia**. 'cause it was now selling, it was forced to sell its oil to a lower middle income customer who could only pay or preferred to pay this non-market rate. That was the entire, you talked to the Biden people, that was the whole play, right? > It was a double play for India against Russia. And so for the Trump people to come along and now say, but you are buying a lot of Russian oil is like bonkers. That was the whole plan to create a privileged market for low income countries that we're gonna take the Russian oil. Because otherwise, if you do oil sanctions right against Russia, it disrupts the global oil market. And the principle victim of that is India. And if the aim of the game is to lure India away from Russia progressively, the thing you don't wanna be doing is antagonizing them by doing generic sanctions that will hurt lower income countries most, right? > At the very end of the line, there'll be Pakistan and Sri Lanka that will really, really be under the wheels, but they don't matter. India really does. And then on top of that, there's this really juicy element of this, which if is the political economy element, which is who benefits, well at some level, Indian consumers benefit and the Indian balance of payments benefits. But the people who really are benefit are Indian refiners because they get to buy the cheap Russian crude, run it through Indian refineries, and then they can sell it to the Indian consumer whose poor and needs the cheapest oil possible, but they can also sell it on global markets and earn the margin, the profit margin. And who is the biggest refiner in India? > Mukesh Ambani, who actually operates the largest refining complex in the world in jam Nagar. And it's estimated that India has shifted from importing minimal amounts of crudes since 2022 in total to have imported about $140 billion worth on, on that. We think that Ambani has probably made in the order of $16 billion in surplus profit from trading on the margin, right? So trading on the margin, basically buying the cheap Russian crude, passing some of that onto the Indian consumers and churning a whole lot of it back into the global market in making. > Now, again, if you are in the business of trying to curry favor with India, not to, not to pun, and to build a strong relationship with India, this may be outrageous, but this is a very good way to do it. Like if you are trying to buy your way into cooperation with the Indian elite, no better way than giving the Ambanis a cut of the action because they're core to the, you know, oligarchic group around Modi. And, and, And it is one of the reasons also where the idea that somehow India's gonna pivot away from Russian crude is just, anyway, this was the game, right? Everyone, I think broadly speaking understood that this was the play and for the Trump people to just kind of waltz in and say, well, you know, go, you can't do this. > Yeah, I mean, and I guess it's important to say that India has been playing by the rules of that game as well. It's not been exploiting. I mean, he's also, there, there was this price cap on, right? That, that was set that India's been adhering to. I mean, there it's been, that > **That was the whole aim, the aim of the price cap was basically to achieve a pain for Russia and a benefit for India.**",ncuuh9j,siddharthvader,0,2025-09-07,RELIANCE.NS,1,0,True,5,Positive,Neutral,bullish,1,0

"Mukesh Ambani explains how he took India to No.1 in just 8 years, during conversation with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang !!",1hsg0zo,2025-01-03,1648,"I mean good on him and all but currently jio's practices are so shady and cheap. No quality services, just cheap rip offs. No respect for customers. Just want to make money at the cost of quality of services (which shouldn't work in the long run, but I'm not sure if that applies to India lol). 1. Them pushing jio air fiber (which just uses existing jio's 5g infrastructure) instead of jio fiber (for which they have to actually spend money to set up the infra and which is miles better). It was a hassle for me to set up an jio fiber installation, they were redirecting me to jio air fiber even if I click jio fiber (which is a practice used by scummy scam and porn sites). But even though I clicked jio fiber and gave my details when the technician called, I asked him whether he was going to install fiber or just a glorified hotspot he said the later (is it even legal to do that). 2. Their flawed push into steaming services just by throwing money to acquire the content without having the infra to host it at the quality the previous owners did. They had more money than those previous owners but didn't want to spend on infra because quantity > quality. Till date jio cinema has the worst UX among all the top streaming sites. Also their hard-on for cutting ""problematic"" content. 3. Their Aquisition of voot was so bad. Voot had live channels but scrapped most of them. No way of transferring voot account to jio cinema premium till after months of voot shutdown (which again I don't know how it wasn't legally mandated for them to have this transfer procedure made aware of all voot subscribers before shutting it down) these are just my personal run-ins with the company. But have heard of many more from other people. He doesn't respect his customers thinks they will eat up his slop if he serves it in a patriotic branded trough. This shouldn't be the case, we should strive for quality and hold people accountable. if not, we will un-ironically become like China and be sold Cheap knock off products like iQiyi, Youku, wechat etc. I'm sure any journalist could come up with even better arguments and proof against their business practices but why is no one doing it ?",m56ctmy,ray__jay,10,2025-01-03,RELIANCE.NS,0,1,True,2,Negative,Neutral,bearish,-1,0
