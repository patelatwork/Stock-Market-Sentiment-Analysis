Vijay Mallya video is pure PR,1l5eves,2025-06-07,4197,"Aur kya puchhega, sb to puch liya. Chor, dakait, lutera tk bolke puch liya. Too bad Indian media cannot stomach the other side's point of view. I'm not saying mallya is a saint but the government could've helped him, a loan restructuring and refinancing could've been done to save kingfisher. I mean if you look at the support and adjustment that has been offered to Ambanis, Adanis and Baba Ramdeo maybe you'd realise that it's almost like the government didn't want him to recover. But hey, it's always easy to make a villain and crucify someone. Everyone loves a good crucifixion, makes you feel good about yourself. Maybe he didn't do enough bootlicking, maybe they didn't like his flamboyant lifestyle and carefree attitude. Obviously he made some very bad investments but he also made good ones. His UB City is still a pinnacle of real estate in Bangalore. United Breweries was never going to fail, a solid cash cow. He made a solid brand out of United Breweries. He made RCB. He wasn't on the correct course with an aim to provide luxurious domestic air travel. He made a foray into the F1 world with Force India. An expensive and always a loss making venture but hey he dared to go where even the greatest fall. Everyone loved his outrageous parties and calendars. But I guess it rubbed off wrong with some very influential people. If you look at this whole thing, one can almost see how many large business houses profited off his downfall and how he was taken apart one by one. Anyways his dues have been paid, more than enough and I don't think he needs to be addressed as bhagoda or chor as of now. I mean Anil Ambani is still a free man after a default of ₹49,000 crore and his company is still here. Shares are skyrocketing and I don't see anyone betting an eye.",mwggg4x,oldval,164,2025-06-07,ADANIENT.NS,1,0,True,9,Positive,Neutral,bullish,1,0

Found my dad’s stock portfolio — where do I start?,1kyvpfm,2025-05-30,2315,"Few observations: 1. Adani group forms ~45% of this portfolio. Do you think you can live with the volatility typically associated with the group in terms of stock prices? Your dad probably has that patience or he just forgot ro sell. But, tomorrow if Adani group shares fall, would you sell in distress or continue to hold? Its a call that you need to make and derisk the portfolio. 2. Does it really help you having multiple shares worth 1k-2k or even less (4 shares of wipro worth Rs995 or 1 ntpc share)? I mean even if wipro moves up 10 times in the next 5 yrs, the value of your shares will only be worth 10K. It will not move the needle much on a 10L portfolio. The portfolio is overdiversified you can look to bring the total stocks 10-12 at max for meaningful gains. 3. Try creating a portfolio which will give you growth as well as dividends, ie, some companies might be in a growing phase and might not be able to give you dividends now but will give them after few years whereas some good companies will give you dividends today as well as grow well. Try identifying such companies. 4. Ultimately, you need to understand how much risk you can take. If you/your dad have other assets that take care of your financial needs then you can afford to take more risk in this portfolio.",mv1nwup,praj17,2,2025-05-30,ADANIENT.NS,2,0,True,5,Positive,Positive,bullish,1,1

Ceasefire: India completely decimated Pakistan and achieved its goal of eliminating most of the terror bases on its border. Don't fall for the Islamist propaganda that India lost. You can read the facts by yourself.,1kjtgg5,2025-05-11,1494,"This is not at all funny, actually we think Trump is a clown but US is playing a very strategic game here. He is playing the same cards he played with Ukraine and Russia. My understanding is he is starting to take interest in Bhikaristan, I would not be surprised if he will start brokering some deals with Pakistan in next few months, Bhikaristan will openly accept it because they are dying with debt. He will use that as a negotiation chip with India and even China. He knows China is developing the CPEC corridor and India already has conflicts in with BHikaristan. That's what Basturd Shebaaz was talking about in the last nights address that they will be successful very soon. This is the whole game plan that US is playing. Adani, Reliance and other industrialist not to mention China should be worried right now, because if this happens then they will have money to fund terrorists without begging for money. US will directly fund them in the name of business and fund terrorist directly. Also no other country will be able to attack them because US assets will be involved. This is an alarming situation, if India don't act right now. Both India and China will loose Bhikaristan. Why does he want to mediate between India and Pakistan now? Has anyone asked him to do that? When he says he does not want to be involved in some other countries conflict then why is he doing it now. This above is the reason Also as a side effect this will require too much too and fro between Indian and Bhikaristan in the name of trade, people, good and money will be exchanged and which will create more loopholes for security in our country.

"All because of a visionless illiterate PM, Indian markets are suffering..She is just a rubber stamp..",1mn7rbg,2025-08-11,787,"1.Demonetisation Disaster (2016) Billed as a move to fight black money and terrorism, it ended up wiping out liquidity overnight. Millions of small businesses dependent on cash collapsed. The RBI itself later admitted that over 99% of banned currency returned, meaning black money holders weren’t really caught. It slowed GDP growth sharply and caused job losses, especially in the informal sector. 2. Mishandled GST Rollout (2017) A single national tax was a good idea in theory, but the rushed and overcomplicated GST rollout confused businesses. Small traders struggled with compliance, leading to reduced profitability and even closures. Frequent rate changes and technical glitches eroded trust. 3. Job Crisis Official employment data was delayed or suppressed for long periods. When it did come out, it showed unemployment hitting a 45-year high in 2017–18. Most job creation has been in the informal or gig sector, with poor job security and benefits. 4. Crony Capitalism Big corporate houses like Adani and Ambani have flourished under Modi’s regime with record profits and favorable policies. Meanwhile, MSMEs (which employ most Indians) have faced credit shortages, delayed payments, and intense competition without government protection. 5. Weakening Rupee & Rising Inflation The rupee has fallen sharply against the US dollar, making imports costlier. Fuel, food, and essentials have seen steady price hikes, squeezing middle-class and poor households. Government’s claim of “controlled inflation” often hides actual price pain felt by citizens. 6. Agrarian Distress Farmer protests (especially over the farm laws of 2020) highlighted deep distress in rural India. Despite promises, MSP guarantees and loan waivers have been inconsistent. Climate change impacts on agriculture haven’t been addressed adequately. 7. Declining Institutional Independence Economic decisions are often politically motivated, not technically sound. Suppression of uncomfortable economic data damages transparency, which hurts investor confidence. 8. Mismanagement During COVID-19 The sudden 2020 lockdown, with only a few hours’ notice, stranded millions of migrant workers without income or transport. GDP shrank by nearly 24% in one quarter — the worst contraction in independent India’s history. Relief packages were criticised for being too focused on loans instead of direct support. 9. Rising Inequality Oxfam reports show that the richest 1% in India own a disproportionate share of the wealth, and this gap widened during Modi’s years. Social safety nets haven’t kept up with the widening wealth gap.",n857niy,Afraid-Surprise-245,0,2025-08-11,ADANIENT.NS,1,0,True,8,Negative,Neutral,bearish,-1,0
