ADANIENT,Whistleblower Documents Reveal SEBI’s Chairperson Had Stake In Obscure Offshore Entities Used In Adani Money Siphoning Scandal,2024-08-10,"I honestly had more respect for Hidenburg before they published the Adani V2. This new article doesn't have much meat, they make 3 key allegations **Claim #1**. SEBI did not investigate the Adani issue raised by Hidenburg in 2022 because the SEBI chairman had a conflict of interest. SEBI Chairman Buch invested \~10% of her networth (\~$860K of $10M) in a foreign fund that had links to an Adani director. This was done in 2015, 2 years before becoming the SEBI chair. She exited the fund in 2018. **Claim #1**: They say SEBI Chairman Madhabi Buch didn’t investigate Adani issues from the 2022 Hindenburg report because she had a conflict of interest. Apparently, she invested about 10% of her net worth (\~$860K of $10M) in a foreign fund linked to an Adani director back in 2015. She exited this fund in 2018, two years before becoming SEBI Chair. **My Take**: This seems like a weak argument. The investment was years before the first Adani report and before Buch even became SEBI Chair. Also, SEBI is a big organization; it’s not like every decision goes through the Chairman alone. This doesn’t really prove a conflict of interest. **Claim #2**: The report points out that Buch’s husband worked for Blackstone in 2019, a firm with big investments in REITs. Hindenburg argues that Buch, as SEBI Chair, was publicly supportive of REITs without mentioning her husband’s connection to Blackstone. **My Take**: This point doesn’t hold up well. Blackstone is involved in a lot more than just REITs, and Buch’s husband was likely hired for his procurement skills, not because of his firm’s REIT investments. If we apply this logic, any association with a company involved in real estate would be seen as a conflict of interest, which seems overblown. **Claim**: The report mentions that Buch and her husband are directors at a consulting firm that earned about 4.4 times her SEBI salary, which is around 2 crore in revenue. **My Take**: The allegation here isn’t very clear. If Hindenburg is suggesting some kind of kickback from Adani, there’s no strong evidence for that. Also, consultants with experience can command high fees, so a revenue of 2 crore doesn’t automatically imply wrongdoing. Consultants, like Buch's husband with years of industry experience, can charge upwards of $2K per hr. Getting \~150 hours of billable work in a year is not unreasonable. We havent had large report coming out on Adani after the Hidenburg v1. Had there been good meat/ allegation possible, investors would have crushed it. We've had investors taking short position and exposing scams in the domestic market (case in point - Manpasand beverage) Moreover, Hidenburg have included passport nos and contact details of Arun Chopra from IIFL - why couldn't they hide/ mask it? How can they be irresponsible with such PII in effort to expose a scam not related to Arun I dont know how market will react on Monday, but I see little real content in this new report",bullish,ADANIENT_hinglish_comments_only_20251018_195908.csv

I hold no brief for SEBI Chairperson (MPB for short). However we need to recognize a hitjob when we see it. Since this sub is about Indian investments, and SEBI is the regulator, please pause before you post your doubts on the institution as such. A few higher level points. * The investment in offshore entity was in a discretionary product - where the investor has no choice on which company is bought; they were made in 2015 and sold in 2018. * The consultancy companies did have revenue in recent years - SEBI had indirectly mentioned that adequate disclosures were made by the chairperson * People have clarified that Blackstone was added to MPB's recusal list when her husband joined the company * It is indeed true that all the 4 REITs were listed in the last few years; however the regulations came in 2014, and the main amendments that made REITs better were made in 2017 - before MPB's time in SEBI * And while still on REITs, enough new stuff has come out in the last few years - InvIT is one example. SEBI put out a consultation for AMCs with only passive funds, and so on... Again, I hold no brief for MPB.

Buchs holdings in IIFL can be considered shady given they are primary entities linking to Vinod Adani and their share manipulating scheme, moreso after transferring all those assets to husband from joint holding shortly after being appointed into SEBI, but what about agora? How is that problematic linking to adani? Is REIT not lucrative enough without her comment? Is it that she sees the potential and decided to abuse her power or is it the otherway around? As in she made her husband director of agora and then she's peddling REITs to pump it? Secondly, according to the article, the stakes Buchs own are... honestly not much compared to Adani.

First, there is no evidence anywhere in the Report to back the claim that the SEBI Chairperson took any bribes. Routine investment instruments have been sensationalised in the Report to create an impression of ill-gotten and opaque wealth. Second, the Report tries to spin the illusion that the mere existence of an offshore entity implies that some criminal activity has taken place. Without any evidence linking a decision or favour to the alleged beneficiary - the Adani Group - the Report clumsily recycles its own earlier claims which were debunked by the Supreme Court.

The matter deserves the attention of the apex court because the SEBI chairperson in January 2014 retired only in February 2017 and is currently serving as “Non-Executive Independent Director-Chairperson” of NDTV, which was acquired by the Adani group in 2022."" *Investigation Findings* The OCCRP investigation has further revealed that a UAE-based secretive firm named Excel Investment and Advisory Services Limited owned by Vinod Adani, brother of Gautam Adani and member of Adani promoter group, had received over $1.4 million in “advisory” fees from management companies of EIFF, EMRF and GOF between June 2012 and August 2014. The investigators have not only dug up invoices and transaction records, but also internal emails which suggest that EIFF, EMRF and GOF were investing funds into the Adani group stocks at the behest of Excel Investment and Advisory Services Limited, that is, Vinod Adani. Therefore, there is now prima facie evidence that entities like EIFF, EMRF and GOF were/are fronts through which Vinod Adani has invested massive funds into Adani group companies stocks. If one adds the shareholding of Vinod Adani in three Adani companies — through offshore individuals and entities like Nasser Ali and Chang Chung-Ling via EIFF, EMRF and GOF, with the disclosed promoter group shareholding of those companies — the promoter group shareholding of Adani Enterprises and Adani Transmission stood at over 78% in January 2017. This would be in clear breach of the 75% threshold contained in 19A of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules. The OCCRP evidence is over and above the ones already provided by the Hindenburg report which alleged a vast global web of tax haven based shell companies run by Vinod Adani through individuals like Chang Chung-Ling and offshore funds such as EIFF, EMRF etc. If more shell companies and transactions are investigated, it could further reveal breaches and contraventions of rules and regulations by the Adani group via the Vinod Adani channel.",bullish,ADANIENT_hinglish_comments_only_20251018_195908.csv

ADANIENT,Adani suspected of fraud by selling low-grade coal as high-value fuel,2024-05-22,"I'm not sure why a thread on investments has to degenerate into politics, where the comments can be summarized as: Adani Bad = Modi Bad = India bad. Are there other points that may be relevant ? I am a former CEO (retired early). While I haven no connection with the Adani group or anyone in infrastructure, I've seen Gautam Adani from the days he was travelling on a scooter trading in plastics. His big break came when he set up Adani port (with a Cong Govt in Gujarat at the time) on what was then waste land. People thought he was nuts for setting up a port close to Kandla, which we then thought was the Gold standard in ports (Adani port turned out to be world class and we could see how bad Kandla or JNPT were by comparison, in for e.g. turnaround time of a ship). Just like Reliance's refinery he took a big audacious bet and created world class infra when there was no immediate need for it. That, for me, is a learning if one wants to get into infra. Most of the Adani projects after the current govt came to power are in states rules by the opposition. Vizhimgam port in Kerala had a anti Capitalist anti Adani, Communist govt of Kerala wooing Adani to run the port. There are also ports in Andhra, TN, Odisha and WB, which are opposition ruled. The point is that a big player in Infra has to be close to politicians on both sides (just as they are in the US). That \`closeness' will invariably involve a bribe, but the politicians bargaining power is less when there is no competitor (offering the same service at a similar price) and when voters want the infra provider (e.g. the state needs power and its SEB cannot supply it). Adani's competitor today is other private solar and wind projects, which will prevent Adani from making windfall profits from thermal power. If the power cost gets too high, industry will move to other states, or domestic consumers will complain. In power, the big gamble of Adani was importing coal, when the view in India was that India had plentiful supply of coal and imports were too costly. Profits came from owning the coal mine abroad, owning the port and the power plant that converts the coal into power. Extraordinary profit comes from all the other jugaad that promoters to - the most common example among Infra promoters is gold plating the project cost. The damage to the economy is worse when the infra company goes bust and cant pay the bank loan (as happened with several companies went to the IBC and had a new owner as a consequence). P.S - I blog on Indian national security, geopolitics and startups in my blog \`DeansMusings'.

Insider trading is trading on a piece of information you got outside of official channels If you overheard and traded on it, it’s insider trading but you are unlikely to be caught because how many times will you overhear something like this Your one trade won’t trigger the checks. If you hear something many times like let’s say you snoop of Deloitte and everytime they audit a takeover deal, you overhear them, your trades will trigger an investigation as it’s odd that you can always be invested in a company that is a takeover target. In many jurisdictions your assets are frozen during the period they investigate you but to start an investigation they really have to have solid ground for suspicion I have known an account being frozen for just 3 insider trades, all happening in succession although the amount each trades was small There was also a case of an Australian data analyst releasing employment numbers to his friend a night before to trade in currencies where both went to jail.

My Indian brokerage personnel are not allowed to trade in their personal capacity. I don’t know about their families trading.

ADANIENT,Sound logical to me,2024-06-06,"Only real case I see here is an unregistered Investment Advisor, Modi (Amit Shah is actually a stock trader and may have an registration with SEBI), gave a stock advice. This falls under civil matter and Modi should be fined and banned from investing in both NSE and BSE. All the conspiracies of pump-dump scheme here is pure political thing. Remember, correlation is not equal to causation. In a pump-dump scheme, the stock that is actually a garbage, prices are inflated, and then insiders exit the company and let the retailer have the losses. In this case, the scenario resembles at the surface level. No way, Nifty 50 and Adani stock (I am mentioning Adani because it had the highest fall and then it jumped by 20 percent in last two days) could come back at the same pre-election prices within 2 days. Even on 3rd June, Nifty 50, despite hitting all time high, has relatively low PE value. That's not how pump-dump scheme works. In Harshad Mehta pump-dump scheme, for example, ACC remained low for whole decade after Harshad Mehta dumped it. Therefore, June 4 market crash could only be proven as panic selling. If anything, despite the smooth recovery of stock market, PE is still low and market is fairly valued. For long term investor like me, I am still putting more money in Nifty. I think the reason Rahul Gandhi made these claims because it is appealing to people and youth of lower strata of society that doesn't understand stock market or only learned about stock market through people like Vivek Bindra.

Indian banks (PSBs so your money) and NBFCs and maybe some arab firms will lend at higher rates. The entire group's interest rates and collateralisation ratios just went up. From the indictment it also seems like the evidence is solid. These guys kept notes detailing not only the bribes paid, but also how much extra power each state would buy and how much that increases the per unit rate for the consumers of that power. They also made PPTs with ""smart wordplay"" to figure out how their US entity would route the bribe money to Gautam Bhai. A US jury that comprises common Americans who are already facing inflation, housing crises and unemployment will be asked to decide if a foreign billionaire is guilty of corruption. Then they'll see all this evidence. Adani can't even pull the insanely shady shit he does through our Home Ministry to chamkau our judiciary on the US grand jury because India-US relations aren't very great, and if we mess with their jury we'll have to deal with a wave of anti Indian outrage and a completely unpredictable President Trump for whom US public opinion matters more than any fake friendship with any Indian leader. I just hope they don't find more evidence proving the Madhabi Buch claims which also seem pretty true, because that will impact the credibility of the whole Indian economy as a good place to invest. The FII pullout is nothing compared to what will happen then. Indian Cos which aren't corrupt and stupid are the ones who will suffer. Every good Indian business will now find it that much harder to get capital. It is a national tragedy if our unicorns, start ups, existing largely non corrupt conglomerates and small businesses suddenly find it way harder to raise foreign capital or have to do so at a higher cost of borrowing.

I'm not saying mallya is a saint but the government could've helped him, a loan restructuring and refinancing could've been done to save kingfisher. I mean if you look at the support and adjustment that has been offered to Ambanis, Adanis and Baba Ramdeo maybe you'd realise that it's almost like the government didn't want him to recover. But hey, it's always easy to make a villain and crucify someone. Everyone loves a good crucifixion, makes you feel good about yourself. Maybe he didn't do enough bootlicking, maybe they didn't like his flamboyant lifestyle and carefree attitude. Obviously he made some very bad investments but he also made good ones. His UB City is still a pinnacle of real estate in Bangalore. United Breweries was never going to fail, a solid cash cow. He made a solid brand out of United Breweries. He made RCB. He wasn't on the correct course with an aim to provide luxurious domestic air travel. He made a foray into the F1 world with Force India. An expensive and always a loss making venture but hey he dared to go where even the greatest fall. Everyone loved his outrageous parties and calendars. But I guess it rubbed off wrong with some very influential people. If you look at this whole thing, one can almost see how many large business houses profited off his downfall and how he was taken apart one by one. Anyways his dues have been paid, more than enough and I don't think he needs to be addressed as bhagoda or chor as of now.

ADANIENT,Found my dad’s stock portfolio — where do I start?,2025-05-30,"Few observations: 1. Adani group forms ~45% of this portfolio. Do you think you can live with the volatility typically associated with the group in terms of stock prices? Your dad probably has that patience or he just forgot ro sell. But, tomorrow if Adani group shares fall, would you sell in distress or continue to hold? Its a call that you need to make and derisk the portfolio. 2. Does it really help you having multiple shares worth 1k-2k or even less (4 shares of wipro worth Rs995 or 1 ntpc share)? I mean even if wipro moves up 10 times in the next 5 yrs, the value of your shares will only be worth 10K. It will not move the needle much on a 10L portfolio. The portfolio is overdiversified you can look to bring the total stocks 10-12 at max for meaningful gains. 3. Try creating a portfolio which will give you growth as well as dividends, ie, some companies might be in a growing phase and might not be able to give you dividends now but will give them after few years whereas some good companies will give you dividends today as well as grow well. Try identifying such companies. 4. Ultimately, you need to understand how much risk you can take.

He is playing the same cards he played with Ukraine and Russia. My understanding is he is starting to take interest in Bhikaristan, I would not be surprised if he will start brokering some deals with Pakistan in next few months, Bhikaristan will openly accept it because they are dying with debt. He will use that as a negotiation chip with India and even China. He knows China is developing the CPEC corridor and India already has conflicts in with BHikaristan. That's what Basturd Shebaaz was talking about in the last nights address that they will be successful very soon. This is the whole game plan that US is playing. Adani, Reliance and other industrialist not to mention China should be worried right now, because if this happens then they will have money to fund terrorists without begging for money. US will directly fund them in the name of business and fund terrorist directly. Also no other country will be able to attack them because US assets will be involved. This is an alarming situation, if India don't act right now. Both India and China will loose Bhikaristan. Why does he want to mediate between India and Pakistan now? Has anyone asked him to do that? When he says he does not want to be involved in some other countries conflict then why is he doing it now. This above is the reason Also as a side effect this will require too much too and fro between Indian and Bhikaristan in the name of trade, people, good and money will be exchanged and which will create more loopholes for security in our country.

ADANIENT,"All because of a visionless illiterate PM, Indian markets are suffering..She is just a rubber stamp..",2025-08-11,"1.Demonetisation Disaster (2016) Billed as a move to fight black money and terrorism, it ended up wiping out liquidity overnight. Millions of small businesses dependent on cash collapsed. The RBI itself later admitted that over 99% of banned currency returned, meaning black money holders weren’t really caught. It slowed GDP growth sharply and caused job losses, especially in the informal sector. 2. Mishandled GST Rollout (2017) A single national tax was a good idea in theory, but the rushed and overcomplicated GST rollout confused businesses. Small traders struggled with compliance, leading to reduced profitability and even closures. Frequent rate changes and technical glitches eroded trust. 3. Job Crisis Official employment data was delayed or suppressed for long periods. When it did come out, it showed unemployment hitting a 45-year high in 2017–18. Most job creation has been in the informal or gig sector, with poor job security and benefits. 4. Crony Capitalism Big corporate houses like Adani and Ambani have flourished under Modi’s regime with record profits and favorable policies. Meanwhile, MSMEs (which employ most Indians) have faced credit shortages, delayed payments, and intense competition without government protection. 5. Weakening Rupee & Rising Inflation The rupee has fallen sharply against the US dollar, making imports costlier. Fuel, food, and essentials have seen steady price hikes, squeezing middle-class and poor households. Government’s claim of “controlled inflation” often hides actual price pain felt by citizens. 6. Agrarian Distress Farmer protests (especially over the farm laws of 2020) highlighted deep distress in rural India. Despite promises, MSP guarantees and loan waivers have been inconsistent. Climate change impacts on agriculture haven’t been addressed adequately. 7. Declining Institutional Independence Economic decisions are often politically motivated, not technically sound. Suppression of uncomfortable economic data damages transparency, which hurts investor confidence. 8. Mismanagement During COVID-19 The sudden 2020 lockdown, with only a few hours’ notice, stranded millions of migrant workers without income or transport. GDP shrank by nearly 24% in one quarter — the worst contraction in independent India’s history. Relief packages were criticised for being too focused on loans instead of direct support. 9. Rising Inequality Oxfam reports show that the richest 1% in India own a disproportionate share of the wealth, and this gap widened during Modi’s years. Social safety nets haven’t kept up with the widening wealth gap.",bearish,ADANIENT_hinglish_comments_only_20251019_165158.csv

Highest credit limit hence keep this for emergencies before I could liquidate my savings. Also use this for Icici card benefits in flipkart that comes at times. 10 percent discount. Amazon pay icici was not giving 10 percent discount on Flipkart for whatever reason. There's also a discount on movie tickets I occasionally take advantage of. 3. Standard Chartered Super Value titanium : Free - because this came bundled with another salary account. Use this for all my fuel and electricity needs. Has 5 percent cashback on both and that's a steal deal. I've never crossed the credit limits in any of the above. Never missed a payment. Heck never even used them if I don't have cash in my account - I don't use and wait for salary to pay. I haven't spent a single rupee because there was a discount. I spent only what I would have spent anyways. And did I tell you, my primary spendings are from my cc for the last 5 years. Credit card is not all that bad it you use it right, honestly..but only a fraction of the cc users would have that attitude which is how the banks make money..and we make cash backs/points.

JIO implanted IPv6 at largest possible scale, hired the best of engineering teams and in the initial days, purchased the best equipments from networking companies. OTOH, the airtel, Vodafone, telenor, Aircel, Docomo, they kept on investing money in marketing, sponsoring cricket series, making Bollywood richer, and relied on the cheapest labor on the ground and overly paid marketing people. Any company which follows this model can be easily dominated, just with money. My opinion is companies which don’t do innovation and spend on hardcore R&D should not exist in the first place. Such companies are liability on the economy, they have overly highly paid top management and the actual on ground workers at minimum wage. Such companies are disproportionately loud mouthed and always keep cribbing about talent or labor or infrastructure.

BHARTIARTL,How Credit card alters your psche and punches hole in your finances,2024-08-03,"This thread is full of people just talking about how credit card is bad while completely ignoring the fact that it's just you lack discipline and proper planning. Been using credit card for 8years , have never defaulted. Have always stuck to my expenses and can even track when I was overspending. It's a ""YOU"" problem not a ""Tool"" problem. If you know to use the tool properly, you will never have an issue. For example, we all pay for and use wifi at home. How many of you know that if you take Axis Airtel credit card while having an Airtel broadband connection, it discounts your wifi bill by 25% upto 250 a month ? You are gonna anyhow pay for wifi every month, no extra spending there. You are gonna pay that wifi bill through your credit card, no extra spending there. And you pay your credit card bill within the timeframe . What do you get from this other than benefits? The credit card has a 500 rs annual fee, you get 250 cashback every month. So without cc , 1000/month bill -> 1000x12 = 12000 With cc , 750/month -> 750x12 = 9000 + 500 fees = 9500. That's a savings of 2500 annually for literally using a cc to pay a bill. No default, one hassle , just benefit. Or take the amazon pay cc, any offline spend you do is 1% . Don't think like "" I have 5L limit on my card , so let me spend "". You should always forget the fact that you have a cc and just think you are spending via UPI . Your family wants to buy gold ? Go to the jewellers with the cash in your bank account, buy it via Amazon pay cc and then pay the credit card the very next day. No hassle and you get 1% cashback. What gives you 1% cashback on gold ? Hell if you are good , you can do it via amex and earn 5% or higher for the same. Credit card is a damn good tool, has its risks yes but also has its benefits. If you learn to use a credit card wisely and with discipline, you will only earn benefits. I do around 15-25k of UPI spends a month , I wallet load it through my credit card , do the same expenses through upi itself while parking that fund in a savings account earning interest . Stop blaming the tool, learn to use it wisely. Being 30+ and not having a credit card isn't bad. But being 30+ , not having a credit card and then confidently saying it's for the best cause you will only get hurt using a credit card shows you lack knowledge and most of all , you lack proper financial discipline.

I was trying to do something similar this morning and thought let me check reddit, someone might have already done it. However, this would be even better if you include all the 1Cr plans everyone is selling. Those offer same/similar benefits at much lesser premiums. I myself own a HDFC Ergo optimum restore (about to expire) and was surprised at how similar it's to their Koti Rakshak policy but offers 6 times less amount (15 lakh). Since I was on the lookout for a policy myself, I did a lot of research as well. Finally bought the Manipal Cigna Lifetime Health. The premium is 25k for 1Cr benefit. I compared it to HDFC, Star, Care and Max Bupa. Unfortunately all of them either had some restrictions on room rent or the post hospitalization cover duration was low. Moreover there was one another criteria that's really important to me: Air Ambulance. I travel quite a lot, at times remote locations and never know when I'll need air lifting. All these things are only available in Cigna. The premiums except Star were similar as well. Star was charging close to 40k, so that was a straight no go. Tough call between HDFC and Manipal but HDFC had a limitation on room type (single private). Also some of the modern practices aren't covered. Network isn't a problem as Cigna has half a dozen hospitals within 2km radius of where I stay. They offer a great accidental cover separately of around 1k for 50 lakh benefit which I am thinking I'll buy later. One thing I'll point at is that opposed to what OP has mentioned, the premium for Cigna isn't over over the top cheaper compared to others.

Their premiums are close for a self+1 family. HDFC seems to be a pure base policy, hence easier for cashless claims, because base & super topup (STU) policy wording/exclusion can and typically do differ, which may lead to complications when claiming - case in point Max Bupa base & STU. But similar premium also means that the pure base policy of HDFC will come with some limitation/sublimit compared to Max Bupa. For example, HDFC has a 75000 limit on Cataract/Tumor/Hernia/Appendix/Hysterectomy (and many other), but I don't know if the limit is reasonable, or how cost inflation will impact coverage of these in future. But there is an optional upgrade for HDFC which will waive most of the limitations like this 75K limit, room rent capping, and will add sum insured restore and enhances No claim bonus accumulation to 50% for non-claim year instead of 10%. I don't know the extra premium for this feature though, yet to talk to a rep. In comparison, Max Reassure (base, 10L) has unlimited restoration( for any member, any illness), so it is effectively 10L coverage for each member even on a family floater, then the STU can cover any cost >10L for each claim. Not an advice per se, just wanted to add/highlight some points, and an alternative to this.

So, you need to fill some forms which can be downloaded and they will arrange you a pick up from bank to collect the form. You don't need to go to bank to submit the form. Bank will charge FX transaction fess which came around RS.2000 for me when I deposited $800 USD. Now, I believe online transaction is available if you have account with HDFC and ICICI. * For Withdrawals - Vested charges $11 + FX transaction fees from bank * For tax - To avoid getting taxed from both US and India there is some double tax avoidance agreement between US and India. Dividends which you get will get taxed in US and Capital gain(Long term/short term) will be taxed in India. For dividends, tax amount will be automatically detected from your account and only remaining amount will be deposited to your Vested account. Everything is clearly mentioned in transaction history. Then, from your vested account you can either withdraw it to your bank or keep re-investing in stocks. * For tax documents - They provide following documents pre-filled for each financial year. General Filings Summary, Foreign asset filing summary, Form 67 filling summary. * Support - So far had good customer support during account opening and for deposit.

HDFCBANK,Common personal finance mistakes,2020-11-16,"The most under estimated factor in investments is Psychology and Behaviour. Reams have been written about it , just a few common examples : 1. Investment in insurance. I agree is a big no no. However, certain people can only save if they are FORCED to save and there are consequences for pre closure or missing a payment. In no way am I endorsing Insurance (other than term). But it’s a fact that lots of people need to have fill it shut it and not be able to remove it sort of investments. 2. If I buy an iPhone for 1 lakh on EMI and invest the 1 lakh I have saved for better returns, then I am clever. But most people won’t be able to figure out a place to invest. Or will be too lazy to do it. 3. Being so busy in daily life, people tend not to be proactive in reviewing their investments. For example, I still have 10,000 invested in HDFC TOP 100 which even today is giving negative returns. And I am already invested in some of the best funds in the country. 4.

HDFCBANK,"PSA: don't procrastinate, buy term insurance before 30/11/21",2021-11-17,"I have been researching a lot about what term insurance to get for the past couple of weeks. Here are some pointers (backed by an excel sheet calculation) which might help you to make a decision. Writing from a perspective of 26/Male/NonSmoker/. Annual Income: 22LPA (PostGraduate) Policy Term: 40 Years (Till the age of 66) I have a STAR Health Insurance policy of Sum assured 5L which will in addition pay 5L on death/Permanent Disability. And a LIC Jeevan Anand which will pay 10L whenever I die. (Regret it though) Companies (should be) considered (in no particular order): HDFC Life, Tata AIA, ICICI Prudential and MAX Life. Go for a reputable brand. Once you're gone your beneficiaries will have to deal with getting the claim. Better the company, easier for them in the moment of grief. E.g. ICICI Prudential @ 26 years of age. 3 Cr - No riders - 40 Years - Regular Pay - Annual Premium \~25k. **Remember:** 1) Insurance is not an investment. 2) Account for inflation (5-6%) while choosing a policy cover. 1 Cr looks great as of now bur 15 years later it won't be sufficient. Choose a higher cover with affordable premiums. 3) Increasing Cover option is a good choice. Limited companies provide it. The cover increases by a fixed % every year till it is 2x the starting base cover. Premiums are fixed lifelong. MAX and Bajaj Allianz offer increasing cover options. (Policy Bazaar) 4) Don't confuse #3 with life-stage benefits in which you opt to increase the cover at marriage/kids and premiums also increase. TATA and ICICI offer Life Stage Benefits. (Policy Bazaar) 5) MaxLife is showing a 5% discounted figure for the annual premium on Policy Bazaar. Your yearly premiums from the 2nd year will be not discounted, so a bit higher. (Refer to the strike-through figure on MaxLife official website for the actual amount) 6) Use dummy data to explore the insurance aggregators and official sites to avoid spamming. (I made an official account 2 weeks later and got 4 property calls in 2 days) 7) You will come across 4 combinations of Term Life: a. Regular Pay means pay for the entire policy term. b. Regular Pay with Return of Premium means paying for the entire policy term and getting all the paid premiums back after the policy term ends, provided you're still alive. c. Limited Pay (5, 10, 12, 15 years) means to pay for a lesser/limited no. of years. The entire premium to be paid is reduced by 50%. (Some policies limit their rider benefits if you choose Limited Paym like ICICI) d. Limited Pay with Return of Premium. (NEVER consider) I'd suggest you outrightly reject everything except a. Considering purely from an economics and Time Value of Money PoV. The Return of Premium (RoP) makes no sense as the amount you'll get after the policy term will be not as valuable as compared to what it is today. The yearly premiums will shoot up by \~1.8x if opted for RoP mode. E.g. You pay 25k for 40 years i.e. 10L in total With RoP, you pay 45k for 40 years i.e. 18L in total. You pay 8L extra to get 18L back. Let's think about investing. If you invest 20k extra per year (1600 monthly SIP) in an index mutual find considering 10% RoR for the next 30 years. You'll make 35L. Double!! Consider LTCG taxes @ 10%, you're still good. The RoR is very conservative. You can fetch 12-15% too! So, you PAY LESS and INVEST the overhead. The Limited Pay option also makes lesser sense from the same PoV. This mode will shoot up your yearly premiums by more than 2x. Effectively, you would be paying less than 40-50% in total. But consider the yearly premium you pay today and the same yearly premium you pay 20/30 years later. The latter will be far easier, far smaller and far less valuable as compared to today. Firstly, the company wants you to pay as early as possible because the more amount they get now, the more they are able to invest. They understand money will lose value as time progresses and it'll be difficult for them to generate returns later on. Secondly, the company doesn't have to keep worrying to get the premiums for the next couple of decades. If you pay earlier and something happens to you in the 15th year of the policy term, it will be a win-win for them because they already have all the premiums. E.g. In regular pay, you pay 25k for 40 years i.e. 10L in total. With Limited Pay, you pay 55k for 10 years i.e. 5.4L in total. Looks good? Wait. 5.4L in next 10 years v/s 10L in next 40 years. So, you pay 30k extra for 10 years i.e. 3L more to reduce your premiums by 4.6L. in the next 10 years! Let's think about investing again! If you invest 30k extra per year (2500 monthly SIP) in an index mutual find considering 10% RoR for the next 10 years. You'll make 5.5L. Keep it going for the next 10-20 years. You make 56L! Consider LTCG taxes @ 10%, you're still better. 8) One more point that companies make is that the longer the policy term more the chances that you may face difficulties paying the premium (you might be short of funds later). But by basic disciplined investing as seen above you can generate enough amount to pay off your premiums for regular policy terms in a very easy way. They also say that in the long run, you might forget to pay off the premium. Even if you miss a premium paying year, the policy is as good as dead. Solution? Switch on Auto-Debit. 9) A limited pay exception might be the case where you can afford to pay and just want to be done with paying off the premiums to clear up liabilities. 10) After payment (online mode) there is a proposal form that needs to be completed for further processing. 11) Opting for the policy from an aggregator say Policy Bazaar looks good. They do help your kin during the claim process. IDK how efficient will they be? Another option is through the official website. And next option is third-party agents. 12) Always opt for YEARLY payment mode. 13) Different insurers cover different no. of critical illnesses in their Critical Illness rider. Tata(40), HDFC(19), Max(64/22 - Very expensive) 15) The Waiver of Premium rider's premium amount fluctuates when you change the life cover amount, paying term and RoP mode. The Critical Illness rider's amount remains the same with changing life cover amount. 16) Combining 2 different policies to achieve max. features and riders will ALWAYS cost more. It boils down to personal choice though. I hope that was helpful. Researched a lot so thought of sharing my 2 cents.

It has happened with me that I didn't pay attention and in a hurry forgot to select NEFT and paid using IMPS. And I had to pay IMPS charges. I wrote to the senior management asking why is it selecting IMPS by default. Let it be NEFT. Now that NEFT is 24x7 money gets cleared in half an hour. Those who want even immediate transfer can choose IMPS manually. I blamed the management that you are earning from the ignorance of user. In response they told me that it's a technical decision by the tech team. I was laughing at their answer. Tech team doesn't take any decision on their own. Until management tells them what to do. But I left it there because the discussion was not leading anywhere. 2. With HDFC I had a Savings account and a LAS (Loan Against Securities Overdraft Current Account). At times it has happened that the balance in my savings account was lesser than the overdraft a/c. For example per say, let say my savings account has balance Rs 10,000 and my overdraft account has balance Rs 1 lakh. Now when I was trying to make a netbanking transaction for electricity bill payment of Rs 500, by default it selects the account with higher balance. So it has happened with me that in a hurry, I paid through my LAS overdraft account and only later I realised it when it starts incurring interest on that amount. I wrote to the senior management again, saying I have enough balance in my savings account (Rs 10,000) > Rs 500 (electricity bill) then why are you selecting overdraft account by default. Had it been the case that I am trying to do a bill payment of Rs 15,000 which is higher than the balance of my savings account, then you can probably select LAS account. But again my feedback went into deaf ears. I understood that HDFC is just to make money off you by hook or crook. That's why I don't keep my money with HDFC anymore. I keep in IDFC. But to avoid monthly average balance charges, I have set HDFC as salary account which makes it zero balance account.

HDFCBANK,"Averaging down, buying more of an asset biggest wealth destroyer: Zerodha CEO",2021-05-22,"Started buying Yes Bank at 278 levels Kept averaging down. Bought 2000 shares in FPO at 12. Finally sold that shit at 13.50 a month back (a 47% loss), more than my 3 months salary. What I have realised is when you have shit stocks in your account and if you need money, you will sell your good stocks. When I needed money in between covid, I had to sell Dmart, hdfc and asian paints. A bad stock not only hurts you financially, it hurts you psychologically, deters you from investing (in some cases), and generates high opportunity costs. Also Insomniac here, but slept so peacefully the day I sold Yes Bank. There are so many stories.

If its companies like HDFC/TCS/Reliance etc which are very strong companies and market leaders in their segments then I can think of averaging down to some extent but I do kind of agree with him. He's speaking from experience and data he collected through his company. Averaging down is probably what causes the losses to go up exponentially most of the time.

HDFCBANK,"Averaging down, buying more of an asset biggest wealth destroyer: Zerodha CEO",2021-05-22,"Averaging down is a wealth destroyer is a blanket statement. Its not true if done right . There's always a right and wrong way to do anything. The best strategy to average down is this - stock must be a good quality stock with solid fundamentals, if the price dips more than 25% from your buy price, then average down only once. If it dips another 25% average down again. This is a win win situation. Just to reiterate this is only for great quality stocks. We are talking likes of hdfc bank, reliance industries, these kind of stocks that have almost no chance of going bankrupt in the near future unless the world ends for some reason.

ICICIBANK,How to save yourself from bank fraud and my experience with it.,2025-05-05,"I am impressed by your knowledge. Good for you. I just wanted to share a really frustrating experience I had in the hopes that it might help someone else avoid the same. First off, I'm genuinely impressed by the knowledge some of you folks have on various topics. Seriously, good on you all for being so informed! Unfortunately, my own experience lately has been far less positive. About a year ago, I fell for a pretty elaborate online laptop buying scam and ended up losing a painful ₹34,000. It started innocently enough on OLX. I found someone supposedly from Nashik selling a secondhand laptop. We moved our conversation over to WhatsApp, and everything seemed legit at first. The payment was broken down into three parts: ₹1k, then ₹2k, and finally ₹31k. After I sent the initial ₹2k, the guy sent me a Blue Dart courier tracking ID. I actually went onto the Blue Dart website, and it showed a parcel had been created and received – which seemed to confirm everything. So, feeling confident, I transferred the remaining ₹31k. That same evening, the scammer went to the courier office, cancelled the parcel, and just kept both the laptop and my money. Unreal, right? Immediately, I contacted ICICI Bank's phone banking. They launched an ""investigation"" that dragged on for three whole months. In the end, their brilliant conclusion was that because I had confirmed the transaction with my bank PIN on GPay, there was nothing they could do. Basically, it was my fault for trusting the process. Not satisfied with that, I filed a cyber complaint. The police told me they needed the scammer's bank account number, but all I had was his phone number and Gmail ID. Needless to say, after a year of nothing happening, my cyber complaint was automatically closed. So, yeah. Neither ICICI Bank nor the cyber police were able to help me recover my money. It's incredibly disheartening and makes me think twice about any online transactions now. Just wanted to share my story as a cautionary tale.

ICICIBANK,What are some of the investing lessons which you would like to share from your life?,2021-01-31,"I had been trading for over a month . My findings had been. 1. Never invest in penny stocks. There is high chance of them being operated by a circuit. They will buy stock in bulk and once stock gets into upper circuit sebi will reduce percentage for upper circuit from 20 percent to 10 percent, 5 percent and so on. Once they can show on chart this penny stock has gained 140 percent over a month. They will circulate this fake tip on whatsapp grp , telegram channels. Even big national daily like ET times will publish the stock name in top gainers and lot of people specially newbies fall for it and pay the price. Once large people put money these operators will pull back their money with sky high profits and crashing the stock. And since the stock has no real reason to rise again ur losses would be permanent. To add insult to injury lower circuit day after day wouldn't let u sell ur stock. 2. Never fell for tips given by research products like icici , CNBC or any others. These r all fluke no matter what they tell u. U can back test their prediction which they recommended one year ago. And check the current price of stock. You would get to know the truth , how their projected targets never reach the prediction. U would only loose money. 3. Intraday is not worth it. Focus on ur career. It's is more important. 4. If you really want to earn money from market either do swing trading . I myself made good money in it each time the sensex has crashed. The second option is do value investing. Buy stocks with good fundamentals that can become multi baggers. 5. Never do swing trading on midcap or anonymous stocks. Only buy sensex stocks on dip for it. Bcoz if u buy any random stock when sensex crashes there is no guarantee that stock will rebound once sensex roars again. 6. U should know it is important to cut losses as well. Sometimes u hold it for too long. But suppose a stock has fallen 50 percent and u r thinking it it will rebound some day . Let's not sell. Then u r wrong . This time this stocks needs to give 100% to get to original value instead of 50% . And even an index fund takes 5-7 yrs to double. So u can imagine holding to avoid losses can be wastage of time which when invested in some other stock would have given u actual profits. 7. Emerging technologies like prosthetic parts companies, AI companies and highly technical startups on Nasdaq can give u assymetric rewards . 8. This is for intraday traders and short term pigs and chickens. Don't trade too frequently. Only sell or buy when u r sure u can get more than 1% profit. Bcoz every time u buy/sell govt will deduct 0.2% and 20 would be ur trading charges. And if u include payment gateway charges as well. U r loosing money and wasting ur time which could be used productively in some other task.",bullish,ICICIBANK_hinglish_comments_only_20251008_231002.csv

The other one is an HDFC Infinia, all family expenses are routed through that one, giving us plenty of points. I deliberately try and spend everything through that card to push up the billing amount, because of the points. Pre-Covid all our holiday flight tickets would come from those points. During Diwali we also give the kids spending money either at Croma or Shoppers stop via vouchers through these points. I never ever roll over the debt, pay it in full and a few days in advance.

Has 5 percent cashback on both and that's a steal deal. I've never crossed the credit limits in any of the above. Never missed a payment. Heck never even used them if I don't have cash in my account - I don't use and wait for salary to pay. I haven't spent a single rupee because there was a discount. I spent only what I would have spent anyways. And did I tell you, my primary spendings are from my cc for the last 5 years. Credit card is not all that bad it you use it right, honestly..but only a fraction of the cc users would have that attitude which is how the banks make money..and we make cash backs/points. Also, grab that credit card if it comes with your salary account. Edit : I added a fourth credit card : Flipkart axis bank credit card. Got it on lifetime free offer. Now this is my go to card because 1.5 percent cash back. Edit 2 : Adding Zomato card as well. Definitely help with my restaurant payments which is a major monthly expense for me. Edit 3 : Zomato credit card is useless going forward. They've cut down a lot on cashbacks. Cancelled this card. Edit 4 : Had saved about 5k with Zomato card before they tore it down. RBL offered me another useless card in Zomato card's place. I denied it. Have added Airtel axis card. This is my first paid card(sigh). 500 Rupees per year. But I use Airtel broadband and that gives me ~250 cb per month. 10 percent off on electricity bill, that would be 100 per month. 10% off on swiggy and zomato upto 500 per month. LPG Cylinder bookings go through this too but I get a cylinder once in like 5/6 months. So overall expecting to save ~400+ per month with airtel axis card.",bullish,ICICIBANK_hinglish_comments_only_20251008_231002.csv

I have done it before, spent too much time trying to figure out where i would get 12 rupees cashback instead of 10 on my 500 rupees recharge and just the mental energy it takes makes it not worth it. Because at the end these offers are meant to lure you in so the companies can charge you more later. Doesn't mean you shouldn't use credit cards or other offers. Pretty much everyone is buying stuff and paying bills online now, so something like the Amazon pay icici card is a great deal, but it's set up once and forget kind of thing. Get the card once and then just pay the bills you were already paying with it to earn free cashback.

ICICIBANK,How to see if a bank is risky for placing your deposits? [A guide from a banker],2020-11-18,"Most Banks are still very far enough from any moratorium type position. It is unlikely that any big SFB or Bank will fail. So if you have money either in Bandhan, Ujjivan, AU or anybank which has to report numbers every quarterly it is unlikely that will fail, LVB was in trouble for a very long time, it has been no surprise that it was acquired by DBS. I also own a bank account which is in a smaller type of Bank(RBL) but for safety I have an alternate account in Kotak Mahindra. As long as you don't have a major amount of money in a corporate bank whose numbers you cannot find and the amount is north worth of 5 lakhs, I wouldn't worry about anything. In terms of safety, these banks are too big to fail as per RBI are SBI, HDFC and ICICI. A very important point to note is there has been no loss of depositors money in any of the bank failures and even in the unlikely event of a very big bank bank failing, it is unlikely the RBI or/and government will let it fail. A simple rule of thumb I use is keep atleast one bank account in one of the following banks - SBI, HDFC, ICICI and Kotak (in the order)",bearish,ICICIBANK_hinglish_comments_only_20251008_231002.csv

Also, many big companies are now much bigger and they find a way to tackle any big issues immediately. (E.g. HDFC bank, ICICI Bank, Infosys etc).

So, you need to fill some forms which can be downloaded and they will arrange you a pick up from bank to collect the form. You don't need to go to bank to submit the form. Bank will charge FX transaction fess which came around RS.2000 for me when I deposited $800 USD. Now, I believe online transaction is available if you have account with HDFC and ICICI. * For Withdrawals - Vested charges $11 + FX transaction fees from bank * For tax - To avoid getting taxed from both US and India there is some double tax avoidance agreement between US and India. Dividends which you get will get taxed in US and Capital gain(Long term/short term) will be taxed in India. For dividends, tax amount will be automatically detected from your account and only remaining amount will be deposited to your Vested account. Everything is clearly mentioned in transaction history. Then, from your vested account you can either withdraw it to your bank or keep re-investing in stocks. * For tax documents - They provide following documents pre-filled for each financial year. General Filings Summary, Foreign asset filing summary, Form 67 filling summary. * Support - So far had good customer support during account opening and for deposit.

ICICIBANK,"Axis Bank has suddenly decided to raise its charges and minimum balance requirements to preposterous levels, what other bank do you suggest?",2021-04-03,"SBI is anyways a good choice in comparison to other public banks. I will however, add something which might not be relevant to this threa. Feel free to ignore it. I have 3 bank accounts: ICICI, Indian Bank (Allahabad Bank) and PayTM Payments Bank. I have a wealth account with ICICI so almost everything is free except for debit card fees. Indian Bank because I have a locker with them and PayTM Payments Bank because of FDs and very smooth payments experience. ICICI Bank is the oldest and in 19 years I have not faced any single issue. For me this is the primary account. Indian Bank is pathetic. Bad customer care, bad mobile app which never works and bad branch experience. PayTM Payments Bank is a delight and I keep only 1 lakhs (as it is the limit) for expense payments (UPI, NEFT, IMPS). ICICI bank does not charge for SMS yet (my wife has a normal savings account) but they do have 10K limit. Indian Bank has Rs. 500 limit and PayTM Bank is free except for debit card fees, if you want a physical card. I can vouch for ICICI and PayTM Bank as I never had a problem with them. ----------- These are the signs to come. All private banks will be increasing their service charges and decreasing their interest on savings instruments (heard it from a bank manager) as RBI has tightened the noose and has asked all banks to make digital payments free for all. The safest option right now, for someone who does not want to pay lot of charges, are public sector banks. But there are trade offs.",bullish,ICICIBANK_hinglish_comments_only_20251008_231002.csv
ICICIBANK,"PSA: don't procrastinate, buy term insurance before 30/11/21",2021-11-17,"I have been researching a lot about what term insurance to get for the past couple of weeks. Here are some pointers (backed by an excel sheet calculation) which might help you to make a decision. Writing from a perspective of 26/Male/NonSmoker/. Annual Income: 22LPA (PostGraduate) Policy Term: 40 Years (Till the age of 66) I have a STAR Health Insurance policy of Sum assured 5L which will in addition pay 5L on death/Permanent Disability. And a LIC Jeevan Anand which will pay 10L whenever I die. (Regret it though) Companies (should be) considered (in no particular order): HDFC Life, Tata AIA, ICICI Prudential and MAX Life. Go for a reputable brand. Once you're gone your beneficiaries will have to deal with getting the claim. Better the company, easier for them in the moment of grief. E.g. ICICI Prudential @ 26 years of age. 3 Cr - No riders - 40 Years - Regular Pay - Annual Premium \~25k. **Remember:** 1) Insurance is not an investment. 2) Account for inflation (5-6%) while choosing a policy cover. 1 Cr looks great as of now bur 15 years later it won't be sufficient. Choose a higher cover with affordable premiums. 3) Increasing Cover option is a good choice. Limited companies provide it. The cover increases by a fixed % every year till it is 2x the starting base cover. Premiums are fixed lifelong. MAX and Bajaj Allianz offer increasing cover options. (Policy Bazaar) 4) Don't confuse #3 with life-stage benefits in which you opt to increase the cover at marriage/kids and premiums also increase. TATA and ICICI offer Life Stage Benefits. (Policy Bazaar) 5) MaxLife is showing a 5% discounted figure for the annual premium on Policy Bazaar. Your yearly premiums from the 2nd year will be not discounted, so a bit higher. (Refer to the strike-through figure on MaxLife official website for the actual amount) 6) Use dummy data to explore the insurance aggregators and official sites to avoid spamming. (I made an official account 2 weeks later and got 4 property calls in 2 days) 7) You will come across 4 combinations of Term Life: a. Regular Pay means pay for the entire policy term. b. Regular Pay with Return of Premium means paying for the entire policy term and getting all the paid premiums back after the policy term ends, provided you're still alive. c. Limited Pay (5, 10, 12, 15 years) means to pay for a lesser/limited no. of years. The entire premium to be paid is reduced by 50%. (Some policies limit their rider benefits if you choose Limited Paym like ICICI) d. Limited Pay with Return of Premium. (NEVER consider) I'd suggest you outrightly reject everything except a. Considering purely from an economics and Time Value of Money PoV. The Return of Premium (RoP) makes no sense as the amount you'll get after the policy term will be not as valuable as compared to what it is today. The yearly premiums will shoot up by \~1.8x if opted for RoP mode. E.g. You pay 25k for 40 years i.e. 10L in total With RoP, you pay 45k for 40 years i.e. 18L in total. You pay 8L extra to get 18L back. Let's think about investing. If you invest 20k extra per year (1600 monthly SIP) in an index mutual find considering 10% RoR for the next 30 years. You'll make 35L. Double!! Consider LTCG taxes @ 10%, you're still good. The RoR is very conservative. You can fetch 12-15% too! So, you PAY LESS and INVEST the overhead. The Limited Pay option also makes lesser sense from the same PoV. This mode will shoot up your yearly premiums by more than 2x. Effectively, you would be paying less than 40-50% in total. But consider the yearly premium you pay today and the same yearly premium you pay 20/30 years later. The latter will be far easier, far smaller and far less valuable as compared to today. Firstly, the company wants you to pay as early as possible because the more amount they get now, the more they are able to invest. They understand money will lose value as time progresses and it'll be difficult for them to generate returns later on. Secondly, the company doesn't have to keep worrying to get the premiums for the next couple of decades. If you pay earlier and something happens to you in the 15th year of the policy term, it will be a win-win for them because they already have all the premiums. E.g. In regular pay, you pay 25k for 40 years i.e. 10L in total. With Limited Pay, you pay 55k for 10 years i.e. 5.4L in total. Looks good? Wait. 5.4L in next 10 years v/s 10L in next 40 years. So, you pay 30k extra for 10 years i.e. 3L more to reduce your premiums by 4.6L. in the next 10 years! Let's think about investing again! If you invest 30k extra per year (2500 monthly SIP) in an index mutual find considering 10% RoR for the next 10 years. You'll make 5.5L. Keep it going for the next 10-20 years. You make 56L! Consider LTCG taxes @ 10%, you're still better. 8) One more point that companies make is that the longer the policy term more the chances that you may face difficulties paying the premium (you might be short of funds later). But by basic disciplined investing as seen above you can generate enough amount to pay off your premiums for regular policy terms in a very easy way. They also say that in the long run, you might forget to pay off the premium. Even if you miss a premium paying year, the policy is as good as dead. Solution? Switch on Auto-Debit. 9) A limited pay exception might be the case where you can afford to pay and just want to be done with paying off the premiums to clear up liabilities. 10) After payment (online mode) there is a proposal form that needs to be completed for further processing. 11) Opting for the policy from an aggregator say Policy Bazaar looks good. They do help your kin during the claim process. IDK how efficient will they be? Another option is through the official website. And next option is third-party agents. 12) Always opt for YEARLY payment mode. 13) Different insurers cover different no. of critical illnesses in their Critical Illness rider. Tata(40), HDFC(19), Max(64/22 - Very expensive) 15) The Waiver of Premium rider's premium amount fluctuates when you change the life cover amount, paying term and RoP mode. The Critical Illness rider's amount remains the same with changing life cover amount. 16) Combining 2 different policies to achieve max. features and riders will ALWAYS cost more. It boils down to personal choice though. I hope that was helpful. Researched a lot so thought of sharing my 2 cents.

ICICIBANK,Whether one should have a credit card or not?,2021-05-30,"I believe that one should not get a credit card right after they start earning. Like me, early credit card users can be a victim of poor budget management. They’ll buy a nice phone on a six month no-cost EMI, then buy a cool gift for girlfriend/boyfriend on a three month no-cost EMI, and worship that credit card because of its power. Once they realize their budget planning is messed up, it will be too late. I couldn’t get out of poor budget management for more than a year, because I had a credit card from the beginning of my first job. If that was not enough, I added another form Amazon ICICI and things went south right after. It’s the spending habits that kill your game. I had bad spending habits.

With over 240 lives lost and the aircraft completely destroyed, the insurance response spans both domestic and international markets. *🔍 Insurance Highlights:* *🔸 Lead Insurer:* The aviation policy is led by Tata AIG General Insurance, backed by Indian co-insurers like GIC Re, United India, Oriental Insurance, and ICICI Lombard. *🔸 Global Reinsurance Support:* Around 95% of the risk is reinsured with major global players including AIG, AXA XL, and other reinsurers in the London and Bermuda markets. *🔸 Hull Loss (Aircraft Damage):* The Boeing 787-8 aircraft, declared a total loss, is estimated to be insured for ₹650–700 crore, based on age-adjusted insured value. *🔸 Passenger Liability:* Under the Montreal Convention, families of deceased passengers are entitled to ~₹1 crore each. With 240+ fatalities, this could result in payouts exceeding ₹240 crore. *🔸 Total Projected Insurance Payout:* Combined hull and liability exposures may cross ₹1,000–1,500 crore, depending on final settlements and legal claims. *🔸 Risk Distribution:* Indian insurers retain only around 5% of the exposure, amounting to ₹50–75 crore, while the bulk will be absorbed by foreign reinsurers. *🔸 Policy Scale:* Air India’s fleet-wide aviation cover reportedly runs into ₹8,000–10,000 crore, with an annual premium estimated around ₹250 crore. *📌 Market Impact:* This incident is likely to harden the global aviation insurance market, especially for wide-body aircraft operators in Asia.",bearish,ICICIBANK_hinglish_comments_only_20251019_152451.csv

Every large MNCs in India have starting jobs around that range even today and hasn’t changed in the last decade. The only reason Infosys and other companies are still getting away with it is because primarily there are people who are ready to work at those prices and conditions. And that’s because there are way too many engineers(1.5 mil each year) of below average quality because of poor education standards. And there are way too many engineers in IT sector because there are no good quality jobs in any other sectors of the country except IT so everyone does engineering(primarily CS/IT) but even non-IT degree students work in these companies. Too much supply very little demand. Just look at some college placements TCS, Info, Tech Mahindra hiring students in 1000’s as if they are in a Mandi and buying engineers in wholesale.

Dont know what holds in the future but there is lot to learn from this narrative. India is on the verge of a potentially transformative oil discovery in the Andaman Sea, which could significantly boost its energy security and economic growth. Here’s a detailed overview of the developments: ### **Key Highlights of the Andaman Oil Discovery** 1. **Potential Scale Comparable to Guyana’s Reserves** - Union Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri has compared the anticipated discovery to Guyana’s massive oil reserves (11.6 billion barrels) . - Estimates suggest the Andaman Sea could hold up to **184,440 crore litres (approx. 1.16 billion barrels)** of crude oil, which could propel India’s economy from $3.7 trillion to $20 trillion in the long term . 2. **Reduction in Oil Import Dependency** - India currently imports **85-86% of its crude oil**, making it the world’s third-largest importer after the U.S. and China . - A successful discovery could drastically cut import costs and enhance energy security . 3. **Exploration Efforts Led by ONGC and Oil India** - **ONGC drilled a record 541 wells in FY24**, the highest in 37 years, with significant investment in the Andaman basin . - **Oil India Limited (OIL)** is actively drilling the **Vijaya Puram-1 well** using the advanced ‘Blackford Dolphin’ rig . 4. **Policy Reforms Boosting Exploration** - The **Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP)** has opened **1 million sq km** of sedimentary basins for exploration . - The **Oil Fields Regulation and Development Amendment Bill** simplifies regulations, encouraging private investment . 5. **Economic and Local Impact** - The discovery could bring **new jobs, infrastructure, and investment** to the Andaman & Nicobar Islands . - Stock prices of **ONGC and Oil India surged** following the minister’s announcement . ### **Challenges Ahead** - **High Exploration Costs**: Drilling deep-water wells is expensive, with each well potentially costing ~$100 million . - **Geological Uncertainties**: The Andaman basin’s geology differs from Indonesia’s successful North Sumatra Basin, requiring further assessment . ### **Conclusion** If confirmed, the Andaman oil discovery could be a **game-changer for India**, reducing import reliance and fueling economic growth. However, further exploration and policy support will be crucial in realizing this potential.

RELIANCE,"Do you think the market will fall because of the recent ""forced"" reduced tariffs of india?",2025-03-08,"Trump’s claim is classic bravado. India’s tariff reduction wasn’t “fear,” but strategic diplomacy to boost trade ties with the U.S. and counter global economic pressures. The Indian stock market is unlikely to nosedive; recent gains in Sensex and Nifty show resilience, with investors focusing on domestic growth and long-term benefits of improved trade relations. As for Trump’s “exposed them” remark—India isn’t playing scared; it’s playing smart. Modi knows how to negotiate without the theatrics. Maybe Trump should take notes instead of handing out free drama lessons! Edit : Trump’s claim that India reduced tariffs out of “fear” is laughable. India’s moves—like slashing auto tariffs from 110% to 70% and cutting whiskey duties by 50%—are strategic steps to boost trade, not a reaction to his theatrics. The Indian stock market isn’t panicking either; Sensex and Nifty rallied this week, with Nifty holding strong above 22,500 despite global volatility. While reciprocal tariffs set for April 2 could impact sectors like autos and pharma, India’s focus on a $500 billion bilateral trade goal by 2030 shows it’s playing the long game.

Low tariff compared to other countries While final trade figures are awaited, between April 2024 and December 2024 (three quarters of FY25), India exported $77.5 billion worth of merchandise to the US, resulting in a surplus of $25 billion. Exposure to tariff is high for Smartphones which make up 7% of the exports to US. Exposure is moderate for Textile (12%), Steel (4%), Auto Components (3%), Solar PV modules (3%), Chemicals (5%), Marine Products (5%), Aluminum (1%). Exposure is low for Engineering & Capital Goods (13%), Pharmaceutical (10%), and Diamonds (7%). These account for 70% of India’s total exports to the US. India will benefit significantly due to either a cost of production advantage against certain countries or a tariff advantage against other countries (China/Vietnam which will benefit Apple devices and Textile, agriculture). Some sectors that can immediately see growth include agriculture, Pharmaceuticals, telecommunications, and textiles. Additionally, the India-US FTA is expected to be signed later this year, which will provide India with a significant advantage and eliminate tariffs.

RELIANCE,Nifty call or put?,2025-04-03,"The reciprocal tariff structure between India and the United States has undergone significant changes under recent U.S. trade policies, particularly during President Donald Trump’s administration. Here’s a detailed overview of the previous tariffs and their implications: ### **Tariff Rates** 1. **India’s Tariffs on U.S. Goods**: - India imposes high tariffs on various U.S. imports, including: - **Passenger vehicles**: 70% (compared to the U.S.’s 2.5% tariff on Indian vehicles). - **Apples**: 50% (U.S. allows duty-free apple imports). - **Rice**: 80% (U.S. imposes a 2.7% tariff). - **Networking equipment**: 10-20%, while the U.S. imposes 0%[2][4][9]. 2. **U.S.’s Tariffs on Indian Goods**: - Previously, Washington imposed sector-specific average tariffs on Indian exports: - Automobiles: 25%. - Gems and jewelry: 2.12%. - Chemicals and pharmaceuticals: 1.06%. - Electronics: 0.41%[4][7]. - Under Trump’s new policy, India-specific tariffs were raised to **26%**, later corrected to **27%** in official annex documents[2][3][9]. ### **Key Sectors Impacted** The new tariffs significantly affect India’s key export industries: - **Electronics** ($14 billion worth of exports) and **gems/jewelry** ($9 billion) face higher costs due to the increased tariffs. - Pharmaceuticals and energy products are exempt from the new tariffs, providing some relief to these sectors[4][6][7]. ### **Policy Rationale** President Trump justified these tariffs as a response to India’s protectionist trade policies, citing India’s average tariff rates as among the highest globally: - Agricultural goods average at **113.1%**, with some rates reaching up to **300%**. - Non-agricultural goods average at **13.5%**[5][7]. ### **Timeline of Implementation** - A universal baseline tariff of **10%** was introduced for all imports starting April 5, 2025. - The higher reciprocal tariffs specific to India (27%) will take effect from April 9, 2025[3][6]. ### **Economic Impact** The tariff hikes are expected to: - Disrupt trade flows between India and the U.S., which is India’s largest trading partner. - Increase costs for Indian exporters in sectors like steel, textiles, and auto manufacturing. - Create opportunities for Indian industries such as textiles and steel as U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods rise[2][6]. ### **Future Outlook** India is actively negotiating a bilateral trade agreement with the U.S., aiming to mitigate the impact of these tariffs and strengthen trade ties further. The discussions aim to increase bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030[6][8].

You can really drill down to 15-20 value stocks. For example you have almost all the big banks & some small ones too in your folio. Try to get only 1-2 stocks from each sector. 2. Very small chunk allocated to each stock. Assume your 10k in infosys gets doubled in 3-5 years. Still you get only another 10k in profit. That too post tax will be even less. Try to pick lesser stocks and allocate a little on the higher side. 3. Keep booking profits. Not all of your stocks will provide value in the long term.

Every large MNCs in India have starting jobs around that range even today and hasn’t changed in the last decade. The only reason Infosys and other companies are still getting away with it is because primarily there are people who are ready to work at those prices and conditions. And that’s because there are way too many engineers(1.5 mil each year) of below average quality because of poor education standards. And there are way too many engineers in IT sector because there are no good quality jobs in any other sectors of the country except IT so everyone does engineering(primarily CS/IT) but even non-IT degree students work in these companies. Too much supply very little demand. Just look at some college placements TCS, Info, Tech Mahindra hiring students in 1000’s as if they are in a Mandi and buying engineers in wholesale.

RELIANCE,Rajiv Bajaj response to 90 hour work week debate.,2025-01-10,"![gif](giphy|6P5jz9bWjCPyIUJQec) Here's a roast to Murthy and Subramanyam from ChatGPT: # Roast Alert! 1. **The Eternal Grindstone Innovators:** * Narayana Murthy's pearls of wisdom suggest that India should compete globally by grinding its workforce into oblivion. Perhaps he forgot that innovation often comes from balanced, rested minds—not from people delirious from lack of sleep. * Subrahmanyan chiming in with Sunday work? Genius. Nothing screams ""build a robust economy"" like turning weekends into weekdays. Because who needs family time, hobbies, or a life? 2. **The Marathon Managers:** * Of course, asking **everyone else** to work 90 hours a week is easy when you're comfortably perched in a boardroom sipping chai. Why not first set an inspiring example? A **""proof of concept"" plan**, if you will. # Sarcastic Proposal Let’s take this *revolutionary idea* and refine it further: 1. **Top-Down Leadership Excellence:** * Start with the **top management**—yes, the **C-suite executives**, including Mr. Murthy and Mr. Subrahmanyan. They should *walk the talk* and consistently clock 90+ hours per week for **4–5 years straight**. No breaks, no Sundays off, and definitely no ""strategy retreats."" Only then can we assess whether this brilliant idea is sustainable. 2. **Trickle-Down Productivity:** * After 5 years of proving this concept at the top, bring it down to the **middle management**. Let's see if they too can survive and thrive with such inspiring leadership. * Finally, after decades of *proven results,* this visionary system can *gracefully trickle down* to the **entry-level workers.** Because why ruin everyone’s life at once when you can do it one level at a time? 3. **Leadership Role Models:** * Perhaps Mr. Murthy and Mr. Subrahmanyan could livestream their 90-hour workweeks for educational purposes?

Indian banks (PSBs so your money) and NBFCs and maybe some arab firms will lend at higher rates. The entire group's interest rates and collateralisation ratios just went up. From the indictment it also seems like the evidence is solid. These guys kept notes detailing not only the bribes paid, but also how much extra power each state would buy and how much that increases the per unit rate for the consumers of that power. They also made PPTs with ""smart wordplay"" to figure out how their US entity would route the bribe money to Gautam Bhai. A US jury that comprises common Americans who are already facing inflation, housing crises and unemployment will be asked to decide if a foreign billionaire is guilty of corruption. Then they'll see all this evidence. Adani can't even pull the insanely shady shit he does through our Home Ministry to chamkau our judiciary on the US grand jury because India-US relations aren't very great, and if we mess with their jury we'll have to deal with a wave of anti Indian outrage and a completely unpredictable President Trump for whom US public opinion matters more than any fake friendship with any Indian leader.

Why would it? Like it's across the Indian Ocean from the Gulf. Like that's where, you know, Indian migrant labor goes to work is in the Gulf. Like why would you buy any oil from Russia? But the entire logic of the sanctions regime has formally understood by everyone who was doing it was precisely the double win of putting a cap on oil prices globally to hurt Russia and enabling the biggest poor buyer in the world, which was India, to go shopping at bargain prices for this oil, which Russia couldn't sell to global markets any more than the cap. **And the whole idea was to divert Russia oil to the most needy and strategically important buyer, which was India currying favor with the Indians, helping to build the quad alliance against China whilst objectively hurting Russia**. 'cause it was now selling, it was forced to sell its oil to a lower middle income customer who could only pay or preferred to pay this non-market rate. That was the entire, you talked to the Biden people, that was the whole play, right? > It was a double play for India against Russia. And so for the Trump people to come along and now say, but you are buying a lot of Russian oil is like bonkers. That was the whole plan to create a privileged market for low income countries that we're gonna take the Russian oil. Because otherwise, if you do oil sanctions right against Russia, it disrupts the global oil market. And the principle victim of that is India. And if the aim of the game is to lure India away from Russia progressively, the thing you don't wanna be doing is antagonizing them by doing generic sanctions that will hurt lower income countries most, right? > At the very end of the line, there'll be Pakistan and Sri Lanka that will really, really be under the wheels, but they don't matter. India really does. And then on top of that, there's this really juicy element of this, which if is the political economy element, which is who benefits, well at some level, Indian consumers benefit and the Indian balance of payments benefits. But the people who really are benefit are Indian refiners because they get to buy the cheap Russian crude, run it through Indian refineries, and then they can sell it to the Indian consumer whose poor and needs the cheapest oil possible, but they can also sell it on global markets and earn the margin, the profit margin. And who is the biggest refiner in India? > Mukesh Ambani, who actually operates the largest refining complex in the world in jam Nagar. And it's estimated that India has shifted from importing minimal amounts of crudes since 2022 in total to have imported about $140 billion worth on, on that. We think that Ambani has probably made in the order of $16 billion in surplus profit from trading on the margin, right? So trading on the margin, basically buying the cheap Russian crude, passing some of that onto the Indian consumers and churning a whole lot of it back into the global market in making. > Now, again, if you are in the business of trying to curry favor with India, not to, not to pun, and to build a strong relationship with India, this may be outrageous, but this is a very good way to do it. Like if you are trying to buy your way into cooperation with the Indian elite, no better way than giving the Ambanis a cut of the action because they're core to the, you know, oligarchic group around Modi. And, and, And it is one of the reasons also where the idea that somehow India's gonna pivot away from Russian crude is just, anyway, this was the game, right? Everyone, I think broadly speaking understood that this was the play and for the Trump people to just kind of waltz in and say, well, you know, go, you can't do this. > Yeah, I mean, and I guess it's important to say that India has been playing by the rules of that game as well. It's not been exploiting. I mean, he's also, there, there was this price cap on, right? That, that was set that India's been adhering to.

Their flawed push into steaming services just by throwing money to acquire the content without having the infra to host it at the quality the previous owners did. They had more money than those previous owners but didn't want to spend on infra because quantity > quality. Till date jio cinema has the worst UX among all the top streaming sites.

RELIANCE,This will teach Bangladesh a lesson for their actions. 🇮🇳💪,2025-05-18,"On May 18, 2025, I came across the news that India has put new restrictions on imports from Bangladesh. The Indian government has now blocked the entry of goods worth around $770 million—almost 42% of total imports from Bangladesh—through land ports. This decision came from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, based on instructions from the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT). Some of the major Bangladeshi products affected include ready-made garments, processed food, plastic products, cotton waste, and wooden furniture. For instance, garments from Bangladesh, which are worth about $618 million a year, can now only enter India through two seaports—Kolkata and Nhava Sheva in Mumbai. Previously, a large part of this trade happened through land routes, especially through West Bengal and the Northeastern states. Now, those land routes are closed for these goods. Another set of items worth about $153 million, such as flavored drinks and plastic items, are completely banned from being imported via land ports. To understand why India made this move, I looked into the background. Tensions between India and Bangladesh have been rising ever since a temporary government led by Muhammad Yunus took charge in Bangladesh. In recent months, Bangladesh has placed several restrictions on Indian exports. For example, since April 13, 2025, Bangladesh has not allowed yarn imports through land ports. Starting April 15, it also placed restrictions on rice imports from India through important border posts like Hili and Benapole. These trade barriers have frustrated India. Adding to this, Bangladesh has been getting closer to China and Pakistan, which has also annoyed Indian policymakers. This isn’t the first time India has responded to these shifts. Back on April 9, 2025, India withdrew a transshipment facility that it had granted Bangladesh in 2020. That facility had allowed Bangladesh to send goods to the Middle East and Europe through Indian ports and even via Delhi airport. Now, Bangladesh can no longer use that route. It has been limited to landlocked countries like Nepal and Bhutan. These new restrictions are likely to hit Bangladesh hard, especially its garment industry, which is a major part of the country’s economy. I found out that in 2023, Bangladesh exported $38 billion worth of garments globally, and $700 million of that went to India. What’s important is that 93% of these exports to India were made through land routes, which are now restricted. Because of this, exporters in Bangladesh may face higher costs and delays, which could hurt their business. Bangladesh is already the second-largest garment exporter in the world after China, and losing smooth access to the Indian market adds pressure. In terms of overall trade, India and Bangladesh had a total trade of $12.91 billion in FY24. Out of this, India exported $11.07 billion worth of goods to Bangladesh and imported $1.85 billion. This was a drop from the $14.24 billion total trade in 2022–23. The new restrictions could lower the trade volume even more and impact Bangladesh’s economy, which depends heavily on exporting to India. From India’s side, the move appears to be a way to hit back at Bangladesh for its recent trade restrictions and to protect local industries, especially textiles. India has made a few exceptions though. Products like fish, LPG, edible oils, and crushed stone are still allowed to enter through land ports. But overall, India seems to be sending a strong message that it is ready to adjust its trade policies to deal with both economic competition and changing geopolitical relationships. Bangladesh is a competitor in the textile market, and India may be trying to safeguard its own position. After looking at all this, it feels like India’s restrictions are not just about trade but also about asserting its influence in the region. By blocking goods worth $770 million from entering through land ports, India is clearly taking a tough stance. While it’s a move to protect its economy, it also reveals the growing tension between the two countries. If this continues, it could have lasting effects on trade and political relations in South Asia.

RELIANCE,This will teach Bangladesh a lesson for their actions. 🇮🇳💪,2025-05-18,"Bangladeshi here. You guys scarce realize what a big L this is. Bangladesh exports about $70 billion a year. Exports to India stands at around 1 billion. Only about 1.5% of the total. Indian Import restrictions do not harm the economy and Indian demand is replacable with alternative international demands. India is a net exporter to Bangladesh, primarily in agricultural and livestock products, fertilizers and vehicles. While there's no inport restrictions on Indian goods, none of your exports to us are critical or non fungible. What this cost India is all the goodwill it had left. While Indians often like to pretend that everyone in Bangladesh is on Pakistan's side, or hates India, the reality on the ground is that a non insignificant portion of the population have a positive attitude towards India. Even after sacking the pro India Hasina regime, many would still argue for closer relations with India. But it's hard to argue for pivoting towards India when their government unilaterally, for no real reason, starts a trade war.",bearish,RELIANCE_hinglish_comments_only_20251019_125953.csv

He will use that as a negotiation chip with India and even China. He knows China is developing the CPEC corridor and India already has conflicts in with BHikaristan. That's what Basturd Shebaaz was talking about in the last nights address that they will be successful very soon. This is the whole game plan that US is playing. Adani, Reliance and other industrialist not to mention China should be worried right now, because if this happens then they will have money to fund terrorists without begging for money. US will directly fund them in the name of business and fund terrorist directly. Also no other country will be able to attack them because US assets will be involved. This is an alarming situation, if India don't act right now. Both India and China will loose Bhikaristan. Why does he want to mediate between India and Pakistan now? Has anyone asked him to do that? When he says he does not want to be involved in some other countries conflict then why is he doing it now. This above is the reason Also as a side effect this will require too much too and fro between Indian and Bhikaristan in the name of trade, people, good and money will be exchanged and which will create more loopholes for security in our country.

Almost every post asking about the IPO was battered down by hoards of people saying the company has shitty fundamentals, shitty track record, shitty CEO, etc. People just don't like Bhavish Aggarwal in general, it seems. The first couple of days after listing was eerily silent on these subs, after everyone who shat on Ola saw their ""technical analysis"" down the drain. If we count both days as listing gains because any sane investor who believes in the company didn't sell, the IPO had already returned 44% by Tuesday. Now a couple of days of profit booking made these people come back screaming, as if they were personally invested in shorting Ola shares. People are stupidly comparing an EV manufacturer and now a lithium cell manufacturer, with service based startups like Zomato and PayTm and cosmetic retailers like Nykaa. They are even comparing an EV startup with other established ICE 2-wheeler manufacturers like Hero and TVS, to justify ""loss making company"". I guess people are just jealous of Bhavish or don't like his face. I think Ola is trying to grab hold of a couple of pretty lucrative sectors, such as EV and lithium cell manufacturing. With the entire world moving away from Chinese products, it's the right time for India to take that place. Ola is at least trying where it matters.

So these people sell the data t maybe 5 paise per person's data or maybe even 10 paise. Selling 10,000 persons' data would fetch anywhere from 500-1000 bucks and its free money. With almost no risk. And even if they get caught they are just fired since banks don't want the data leak to be public information. When I took a SBI CC i got a call almost one week later wherein a lady said that I had pending sign up offers and that my CVV needs to be shared.

SBIN,Survived a Credit Card fraud today. Sharing my experience for an educational purpose.,2021-08-19,"I think not sharing the OTP saved you a lot of money and mental harassment. Victims get communication from fraudsters impersonating NBFC employees and offer loans or credit enhancement limits with just a phone call. Once you call the number, the fraudsters either ask you to fill privy financial details or share OTP or PIN details, resulting in loss of money. These days, credit card frauds are becoming so rampant and especially post COVID, people are playing on the vulnerabilities of the ones that have been affected financially. Increasing credit limits and offering free credit cards with no processing fee are ways to lure people into giving away money. My knowledge on fraud awareness by **Bajaj Finserv** and SBI also tells me that scam types include blocking the card if you don’t perform an action, threatening to suspend accounts, counterfeit and skimming frauds, honestly, the list is endless. I had received an email asking me to click on a link to update my KYC details or my no-cost EMI card from them would be blocked.

SBIN,I found this solid PPF advice and want to share with this community,2025-07-05,"To all the peeps who might not know and to addon to OPs post - Tip 1: You don’t add money in PPF, when it’s about time to submit investment forms ( Jan - Mar) but instead deposit it in start of financial year I.e. April so that you can get interest for the full year. Tip 2: This is super wisdom 🦷 tooth - never make the mistake of transferring funds on 1 Apr. 1 Apr is bank reconciliation day and amounts are returned back. This may go unnoticed specially if it’s a bank like SBI and leads to a penalty if not reinitiated. Tip 3: You can make a partial withdrawal, if needed for an emergency 🆘 however, you must not default on yearly payment. I.e. every year you must make a deposit of atleast Rs 500 but don’t make the mistake of skipping putting money in a financial year Tip 4: This may not be true now because tax regime has changed but 1.5L is the total tax benefit one could claim in old regime for general savings .. so rather than putting money in different baskets or claiming deduction from various sources, it’s best to put the full 1.5 L at one go to your PPF in Apr itself.

Indian Bank because I have a locker with them and PayTM Payments Bank because of FDs and very smooth payments experience. ICICI Bank is the oldest and in 19 years I have not faced any single issue. For me this is the primary account. Indian Bank is pathetic. Bad customer care, bad mobile app which never works and bad branch experience.

TCS,Nifty call or put?,2025-04-03,"Trump's trade strategy, known as the Mar-a-Lago Accord, is inspired by a similar plan from the 1980s called the Plaza Accord. His goal is to change how global trade works to benefit the U.S. economy. This plan has three main steps: Trade Negotiations – Trump is using tariffs (extra taxes on imported goods) as a way to pressure other countries into negotiating better trade deals for the U.S. The idea is that if other countries want to avoid high tariffs, they might agree to lower their own trade barriers for American products. Dollar Devaluation – The U.S. will aim to weaken its currency (the dollar). A weaker dollar makes American products cheaper for other countries to buy, which could help boost exports and reduce the trade deficit (the gap between what the U.S. imports and exports). Debt Restructuring – The U.S. wants to manage its national debt by changing how foreign countries hold U.S. government bonds, possibly extending the repayment period or converting them into bonds that don’t need to be repaid quickly. What’s Happening Right Now? Trump is currently in Phase 1, where he is using tariffs to gain leverage in trade negotiations. For example, if a country like India imposes high tariffs on American products, Trump’s strategy forces them to reconsider. Rather than entering a trade war, India might lower tariffs specifically for U.S. goods while keeping high tariffs for other countries. This gives American businesses an advantage. The Big Picture Trump is also pushing a 10% tariff on all imported goods to encourage companies to manufacture more within the U.S. However, this is ironic because, at the same time, he's asking other countries to remove their tariffs. Another key move is a 25% tariff on imported cars, which helps the U.S. auto industry. Car factories are important because they support the steel and aluminum industries and can even be repurposed for military production if needed. Why Are Some Countries Hit Harder? Some countries, like Cambodia and Vietnam, are facing extremely high tariffs (49% and 46%). This is likely because they are becoming too dependent on China, which the U.S. wants to contain. The tariffs may be a way to pressure them to distance themselves from China. The Hidden Strategy Trump is only focusing on goods trade deficits and ignoring services trade, where the U.S. actually has a surplus. This benefits countries like India, which exports IT services to the U.S. through companies like TCS and Infosys. Overall, this plan is designed to strengthen U.S. manufacturing, pressure other countries into better trade deals, and counter China’s growing influence.",bullish,TCS_hinglish_comments_only_20251008_154113.csv

Every large MNCs in India have starting jobs around that range even today and hasn’t changed in the last decade. The only reason Infosys and other companies are still getting away with it is because primarily there are people who are ready to work at those prices and conditions. And that’s because there are way too many engineers(1.5 mil each year) of below average quality because of poor education standards. And there are way too many engineers in IT sector because there are no good quality jobs in any other sectors of the country except IT so everyone does engineering(primarily CS/IT) but even non-IT degree students work in these companies. Too much supply very little demand. Just look at some college placements TCS, Info, Tech Mahindra hiring students in 1000’s as if they are in a Mandi and buying engineers in wholesale.

Tata cliq - wonder why this portal even exist. Nothing exciting ni wide categories. It's just for the sake of having ecommerce platform 8. Tanishq - in the name of quality they charge 10-15 percent higher than market price They are solely living with Ratan Tata brand name. With he being no more. I think tata as a brand might fall apart. Remember even when it's a desi brand. Atleast for motors part. Most of their cars are designed by Jaguar engineers acquired by Tata. It's not made by Indian minds. Atleast Mahindra has Indian minds in designing their new cars. But Tata doesn't. CEO of Tata group Chandrasekaran. Shamelessly tells in press..we have resolved most of the service related issues with Tata cars .where harrier ev was getting released. Trust me I am part of 600 member group of Punch ev.. almost 80 percent of them have atleast one complaint which is not resolved by the service center. Even lost patience going to SC. We are resolving all small complaints by ourselves. They will try to portray they are pioneer of ev sector In actual they are trying to milk ev customers. Looks at the pioneer pricing for tata ev chargers . Almost 22-24 re per kw. Whereas govt had asked to set 11 during solar and 13 during non solar hours. They shouldn't call them pioneer.
